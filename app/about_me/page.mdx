My main passion is web development and lucky me it is also the thing I do for a living. I currently live in Luxembourg (well I did most of my life) and I'm luxembourgish. I'm 40ish old (I stopped counting) and I speak Luxembourgish, German, French and English fluently.

I have NO higher education degree(s) in anything, because I left school early to do what I was passionate about and which is programming (but that was long ago, today there are a lot of opportunities to study programming, so if I was a teenager today I might do it differently).

I'm self-taught, which means everything I know today is knowledge that I aquarid by working with others on projects in companies or open source. Also in the early days I learned a lot by reading books (yes kids we did read books back then), today I keep myself up to date by reading online tutorials and blog articles. I also learn a lot by looking at other peoples source code (I like to check out repositories on github). Of course I make extensive use of stackoverflow and sources like MDN Web Docs. When I have time left I do prototypes for fun during my afterwork time and sometimes I watch youtube videos about web development or any of my other hobbies.

Another hobby is building things out of Lego bricks. I played with Lego as a Kid and then stopped spending most of my free time playing video games. Today I still play video games (I dream of programming one myself some day), but I also rediscovered building with bricks. This brings us to yet another hobby which is watching movies and TV shows (mostly on Netflix these days and a bit of Disney+), I enjoy turning on the TV in the evening but I can never just watch TV, I always either play a game on my iPad while the show or movie is running or I build something with Lego, which is something I like a lot because it really helps me relieve stress.

Another passion of mine is music. I have a lot of playlists, because obviously life is much better with a great soundtrack playing in the background. I don't play any instrument myself and I'm not a good dancer but I like creating playlists and then listening to them while in my car (a blue Mini Cooper), riding my bike (a golden Aprilia RS 660) or while working on something.
