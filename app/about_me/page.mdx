It's a me, ChrisWeb!

I often use the **ChrisWeb** as username for two reason, first because my full name is chris weber so chrisweb made sense but then also because I'm a **web** developer that loves programming so chrisweb made sense in that regard too, sometimes I use chriswwweb when chrisweb is taken, I think it is a funny extension of my username that adds **www** to the name, making it even more about the web but still keeping it kinda short

As I described in my [games](/games) section, I got my first Amstrad CPC computer when I was 9 and because I loved to play games at some point I wondered if I could learn to make my own games, so when I was 10 I bought my first programming book about games and started typing the several pages long examples from the book into files on my Amstrad, I didn't yet know what I was doing but it was very satisfying to see something I had been typing for hours finally run on my computer, the first real app I coded on my own was a calculator, it helped me learn the basics and later on I tried to extend it to make it more powerful

Even though my first program was a caculator, this doesn't mean I was a big fan of math, I was actually pretty bad at math and I still am today, but even though my teachers told me I would never become a programmer because I was not good at math, hey look I still made it and became a programmer ðŸ˜Š, so hey kids if you want to learn programming just start programming random stuff to learn bit by bit how programming works (don't get me wrong though, there is nothing bad at being good at math, if you are hurray that's great but if you are not don't let anyone persuade you that you can't become a programmer / developer)

After tinkering on my Amstrad and learning the basics of game programming ðŸ‘¾ and then sharing my games on Floppy disks ðŸ˜² with friends, I finally got my first PC and with it my first modem, which meant I now had access to internet
