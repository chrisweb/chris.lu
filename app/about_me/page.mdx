# About me

It's a me, ChrisWeb!

I realize this page is not at all the usual 10 sentences about me page you find on a lot of websites. But I started writing and it kept flowing and I had fun writing it down. Also I'm not a kid anymore, so obviously I got some a few things to tell. I could probably try to do a TLDR some day or maybe I ask chatgpt to do one for me 😂 but I'm sorry I have no TLDR yet

## the early days of programming

I often use the **ChrisWeb** as username for two reason, first because my full name is chris weber so chrisweb made sense but then also because I'm a **web** developer that loves programming so chrisweb made sense in that regard too, sometimes I use chriswwweb when chrisweb is taken, I think it is a funny extension of my username that adds **www** to the name, making it even more about the web but still keeping it kinda short

As I described in my [games](/games) section, I got my first Amstrad CPC computer when I was 9 and because I loved to play games at some point I wondered if I could learn to make my own games, so when I was 10 I bought my first programming book about games and started typing the several pages long examples from the book into files on my Amstrad, I didn't yet know what I was doing but it was very satisfying to see something I had been typing for hours finally run on my computer

## my first own code using BASIC and Pascal

After tinkering on my Amstrad and learning the basics of game programming 👾 and then sharing my games on Floppy disks 😲 with friends, I finally got my first PC

The first real app I coded on my own was a calculator, using a programming language called [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC)

Even though my first program was a caculator, this doesn't mean I was a big fan of math, I was actually pretty bad at math and I still am today, but even though my teachers told me I would never become a programmer because I was not good at math, hey look I still made it and became a programmer 😊, so hey kids if you want to learn programming just start programming random stuff to learn bit by bit how programming works

> [!NOTE]  
> don't get me wrong though, there is nothing bad at being good at math, if you are hurray that's great but if you are not don't let anyone persuade you that you can't become a programmer / developer

A few years later I started using [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) to still create mini games, I remember one of those games was a space shooter, where you were controlling a space ship that could move to the left and right and you could shoot at incoming asteriods to destroy them, it was a bit like an [Out Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run) game but in space, it had very basic vector graphics, it was very simple but fun too

## my first website

When I got my second PC it came with a modem, which meant I now had access to internet, it was mind blowing

![](../../public/assets/images/app/about_me/mind_blowing.gif)

That's when I discovered that a new service had just been founded called [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities), allowing me to create my own website and put it online. So I started learning HTML and later [DHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_HTML). So after learning how to use [&lt;blink&gt;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_element), `<center>` and how to add a small image (that repeats itself indefinitely) as background, I was ready to create my first website to share my hobbies with the world. To get an idea of what we were building check out this geocities archive called [](https://geocities.restorativland.org/)

## tombraider.net and dropping out of school

I had read news in gaming magazines about an uncoming game called [Tomb Raider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_(1996_video_game)) starring [Lara Croft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Croft) a female Indiana Jones like character. It seemed to be promising game and so I searched for available domains, of course tombraider.com had already been registered by Eidos the game developer of Tomb Raider but I was extremly lucky to be able to register tombraider.net, which was my first domain name ever 🙂. So even before the game got released I started using all my knowledge from building websites on GeoCities and started building a HTML website for the game. I started collecting all information about the game I could get and even though my english was not that great at that time I finally was able to put the website online. When the game got released I already had dozens of daily visits, so I was motivated to continue, I added screenshots, a walkthrough, background information about a potential sucessor and so on. 

> [!NOTE]  
I was able to find traces of my [tombraider.net website from april 1999](https://web.archive.org/web/20000510125725/http://www.tombraider.net/) in the internet archive, but unfortunatly none of the images got saved, bummer You can check out the internet archive 😥

The website quickly gained in popularity and before the release of the second game I had been contacted by an american company which at that time was operating the very popular gamers.com website. They offered me to become part of their GX Network, which meant I would put their banner ads script on tombraider.net and they would send me a check every month, for a percentage of the revenue the ads would generate.

When the second Tomb Raider game got released I was doing final year of high school and the amount of number on the checks I was getting kept increasing to a point where I wondered if it was really worth continuing with school. Disclaimer: at that time I was NOT learning web development at school, which was my dream, but instead I had enrolled in a program that had a lot of math and science classes because I had been told that programmers need to be good at math, it was the only option that was available at that time. It was still the early days of the Internet and so only a few universities had programming courses at that time and to attend one of these I would have needed to have really good grades but my grades were actually getting worse every year because my motivation kept dropping to new lows.

So I decided to drop out school and focus on tombraider.net fulltime. My parents were not very enthousiastic to say the least but they still supported me, it is not that they didn't want me to do it, but it was not easy for them to understand how, why and even what I was doing and they were afraid I might regret dropping out at school later in my life. I had become a young adult working from home, I had a blast working on tombraider.net, trying to improve the website, adding content, promoting it, travelling to conventions but most importantly creating an interactive website always trying to include and make good use of the latest technologies.

## THE END of tombraider.net

After a while the popularity of the Tomb Raider games started decreasing, so the amount on the checks got smaller and eventually some day the GX Network stopped sending checks. The internet bubble had burst.

Coping with the failure to see the end of tombraider.net coming and missing the opportunity to plan ahead so that I would have other websites to pay my monthly bills were the biggest mistakes I ever did. I felt really bad at that time and wasn't sure how to move on, I knew I had to stop being sorry for myself and start finding a new opportunity.

## Living in a flat-sharing communuty and my Nonprofit organization

Around that time I met some people that were active in Nonprofit organizations and they had planned to rent a house near where I was living to move in together and build a community of like-minded people. I had never done politics but I had gained some experience representing school students on local and national level back when I was in school and so doing activism to try to achieve political or social change was appealing to me and so I left home and joined the community.

I quickly realized that I had a talent that could benefit the Nonprofit organizations that the people around me had created and that was supporting their efforts by building websites and other digital tools to help them manage and distribute their content. So I created my own Nonprofit organization and started working on a tool using a programming language called [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)), the main goal of the tool was to enable people (that had no idea what html, css or even javscript was) to build websites. I kept on working on my windows no-code website builder and after a few months I had built a tool that enabled people to create a navigation bar, add pages, link them together and of course fill them with content. Then when done you would click on a build button and the tool would convert it to an HTML website ready to be published on a server.

At some point a designer and a system administrator joined me, so that we were able build even bigger and more beautiful websites. We started adding dynamic online discussion forums using [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), built intranets and at some point we even created CD-Roms filled with content to be distributed as add-on of a magazine. At that time only big companies could afford to create big websites and so we were really happy to be able to build tools to help Nonprofit organizations distribute their content, but at a fraction of the prize that web agencies were asking for such products. Of course we had to make a living out of it and that was made possible because we were able to get subsidies from the government and European Union.

## Dubious life decisions and failing (again)

Unfortunatly the subsidies were limited in time and so year after year we got less money to support the projects of our Nonprofit organization.

At that time I also started playing more and more World of Warcraft and at some point even joined a semi professionnal esports organisation that consisted of WoW players trying to do europe first or even world first boss kills in the game, to then produce videos of our achievements and sell these to gaming websites and magazines. The project never took of and so I was not able to earn enough money from it to make a living.

This is when everything came crashing down on me once again. I had no more money to pay my monthly bills and started to fall into a deep depression. I had no other choice and needed to ask my parents if I could move back in with them and fortunatly for me they agreed.

## getting back up

It took me some time to get better, but once I started once again to realize that drowning myself in self pitty was not going to make things better, I finally got back to learning web development. I mean I was a young, unemployed adult living at his parents place, so I had nothign better to do.

I read a huge amount of books during that time, web development consists of such a vaste quantity of areas that you can learn to master, so that sometimes it seems like it is too much but it also is what is great about it, because the possibilities are endless. I like working in teams, because you can chose which area you like best and improve your skills in that area, while the others in your team will handle the areas you are not so good at.

To give you an idea of what my book shelves looked like, here are two old photographs I was able to find:

## my first real job... somehow

I was not very motivated to get a job at a regular company, I mean I had been my own boss for several years, had worked on countless projects I was passionate about, I was working from home surrounded by people I had a lot of fun with. And you know what? I was even worse then what I had anticipated. I mean I got used to working 8 hour or more a day in an office quickly, that wasn't the problem, but the company was so tiny they didn't have enough contracts to keep me doing web development all day long, so they asked me to do other tasks, like filling packages for online orders and things like that. That part was fun at all, but at least I was doing some web development and most importantly I was earning money again. During that time I also spent my evenings improving my PHP skills and building side projects.

## my second real job "the green triangle"

I kept searching for a new job and found an ad for a job at the biggest media house in Luxembourg. It was a job position for a web designer, I read the offer and it included things like CSS and HTML so I thought, hmmmm maybe it is more about building HTML websites than it is about doing actuel design work in Photoshop, let's give it a try, I have a job so nothing to lose. 

In the interview they told me that I had to work on a small project so that they could evaluate my skills. The task was to build a website for a gardening fictional company called "the green triangle". They asked me if I wanted them to install and IDE and tools for me and I told them, no that's fine all I need is Notepad and started coding. I was not a designer and had no idea what to do, to make the website look good, I also wasn't inspired by the name of that fictional company "the green triangle", so the best I was able to come up with was to put a big green triangle in the top right corner of the website. And guess what? Well I showed them my project and they couldn't keep laughing at my green triangle for 5 minutes, I started laughed to because what I had just done looked so ridicouly bad. But then they looked at my code and they were like, wait did you do all this just in notepad, without autocomplete from an IDE like [Dreamweaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver), in just two hours? I did not know what to say other than I loved coding websites and liked a lot to learn new things in that area. They told me that obviously I wouldn't get the job but that another team was about to publish an offer for a PHP developer and that they would share it with me so that I could apply there.

So I applied again this time for a PHP developer position, went to the interview, coded a small PHP backend from scratch using Notepad, including a SQL connection to write and read data, as well as a basic template engine to display the data and have some input forms, in less than 4 hours (I had spent days preparing for the interview memorizing how to write a mysql connect and other things). A few days later I got a mail telling me I could start next week.

Even though the company was a big media corporate company, working there didn't feel like I was only a number. The team I joined was actually the remaining employees of design agency that had been bought prior to me getting hired, the agency was called Eleven and the team kept that designation for themself, meaning we were part of the It department but also a seperate entity. I enjoyed working there a lot, my coworkers were kind and funny, the projects were interesting and so kept on growing as a developer, finally my passion had become a real job. I spent 4 years in that company and was not even planning to leave, but then I got an appoched by a head hunter for a better paid job in another company that seemed to be very interesting too, so I applied and got the job.

## the jamendo.com years

When I joined jamendo, the company was still operating like a start up, but had existed for more than 10 years already and apparently had gone through some big ups and downs. The first few days I was still wondering if it was a good idea to leave a team I liked working with a lot, but the jamendo team was very welcoming and nice too. Actually the people at jamendo were what kept me there for 4 years. I worked with a lot of very talented but also kind and funny people, plus the things I had to work on were very interesting.

In the first two years I slowly started transitioning from writing PHP for the backend to writing Javascript frontend stuff. The jamendo code was not bad, I mean they had over a million monthly users using the service, but neither the frontend nor the backend were using a framework. So the decision was made to rewrite the backend using [Zend Framework](https://github.com/zendframework/zf1) and the frontend using [Backbone.js](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone). So at first I helped with the transition of the vanilla PHP code to Zend Framework and later with the transition of vanilla Javascript with some jQuery to Backbone.js.

During my first two years I had spent a lot of time improving the codebase but I also felt we could do improve things from a product perspective. So I kept suggesting changes to how things worked, asked if we could add new features and started discussing the product with people working in other departments as well as users of the product. I really liked the product, I mean who doesn't like to listen to music? 😉 and I became more an more interested in project and product management. Until the fateful end of year party at the end of my second year, some people will tell the story differently but here is how I remember it: so were at a club that had been rented for jamendo and also the parent company, we had bracelets that allowed us to order free drinks, so we did and at some point I was at a table witha music manager and also the CEO of the parent company and I told him I had some Ideas to improve the product and increase the amount of users substantially. But then nothing happend until a week or so later when I got the news that after having talks, jamendo and the parent company had decided to create a new team that would focus on jamendo music (the free music service part) and that the current team would focus on the second half (the jamendo licensing part) and this is how I became the product manager of jamendo music.

So for almost a year we worked on a radically new free music platform for jamendo. We rewrote big chunks of the code, introduced a new concept of music communities where each community would have their own currated playlists, charts, trending section (that had a ranking algorithm that calculates a score based on the amount of likes, comments and reviews a song has gotten, each data point then gets multiplied by coefficent representing how important a metric is compared to another and finally that score gets divided by the amount of days that passed since the song got released, meaning fresh content would always have the highest score). We merged the like and bookmark buttons into a single ❤️ (heart) button which would be used by users to show their appreciation, would add the content to their own library and also be used by our algorythms to identify what kind of content users like the most. We spent a lot of time, creating prototypes, analyzing big amounts of data to try to decisions based on numbers and not solely on our opinions. I tried to include members from other teams to bring developers, designers and music managers to the brainstorming table as much as possible so that we could create the best possible product together.

Then came the grand opening. We had some technical difficulties at first, but we also had a great team of developers and were able to solve most of the problems quickly. However I leaned the hard way that working in stealth mode for a long period of time and then replacing a product that had not changed for years by something radically new, was not a good idea. I was sad to see the numbers in google analytics go down instead of going up. So we quickly created a google form and put it on the website to gather feedback from our users, we got thousands of answers in just a few days and the overhelming majority told us that they were shocked to see the website change so drastically from one day to another, making it very hard for them to find and do the things the way they had been used to do for several years. My big mistake was that I had completly underestimated what a shock it would be for our users. It didn't matter how good the new version was in comparison with the previous one, what mattered most was how different it was. I learned a very important lesson that day, if you change the way you product works, do it step by step, one feature at a time instead of trying to do it all at once. We did so much all at once, because it would have been hard and cost us much more time to do some changes without also touching other parts, but that's not an excuse, I should have tried harder to split the update in several smaller chunks and release them one by one, the added benefit would have been that users would have seen that we work on the product and are fixing and improving things on a regular basis.

Fortunatly for me, after a few weeks the numbers went to where they were before the release and some more weeks later we were started seeing some very encouraging increases in some areas, validating the hopes we had when building the new platform. I stayed for another year after the release, making it 4 years I had spent a jamendo but one day the newly appointed CEO decided to lay off some of the people I had enjoyed working with for years. I don't like leaving a company because I know that I will miss working with the people I have enjoyed working for 4 years, but as some off them got laid off, it only took me 5 minutes to decide that it was finally time for me to start that sabbatical year I had been thinking about for some time.

## the clubee.com years

The clubee chapter was enjoyable and challenging at the same time, but it was also everything I had expected, no big surprises, just a normal and enjoyable time building a SAAS service to help sports clubs manage their day to day operations. I won't lie, not every day was a tele tubby happy fantasy, work in a startup can be very stressful, but the good stressful (for me bad stressful is the stressful situation where stress makes you less productive, the good stressful however is the kind of situation where you realize you are working on something great, you see all the pieces the team has been working on finally come together and you can see the finish line, so you decide to give 200% and make it happen). It was enjoyable because I once again met great people and very talented developers, also challenging because it was a start up in full start mode, but don't get me wrong, I like to have a mix of challenging times with more calm periods in between, I mean the worst that could happen is to have a boring workplace where time passes slowly. At clubee time passed very quickly, I joined clubee, drank a few coffees, worked for the development team as C.T.O., managing work plannings, helped take technical decisions and helped shape some of the new features by being the link between the dev and the product team and boom 4 years had passed.

The most difficult period was when Covid hit, because Clubee was a sevice for sports clubs that had all stopped operating for over a year, made it a very difficult period for the company. But the management team was able to navigate through those difficult times without lay offs or any other drastic measures. It was certainly not easy, not seeing your coworkers for so long period wasn't ideal, but I think we did the best out of it, we changed the way we worked together, we even transformed our after work events to online events where everyone in the team would prepare their favorite drink at home and then join the others in online team games. Don't get me wrong, I like working from home a lot, I think it helps me focus on my work and makes it easier and faster to switch between working hours and time off, hence not wasting countless hours in traffic jams every day is a big quality of life improvement for me. But on the other hand I also find it helpful and enjoyable to be in an office with the others from time to time. I like spending one day per week to have in person meetings with members of the team(s), be able to have lunch together or have an afterwork poker game when the work is done, are all very enjoyable things to do during that day and help the team be more than "just" coworkers

## a sabbatical to update my memory banks

I'm currently doing my second sabbatical year, I have worked on mobile app for Beachvolleyball players that is called [Beavo](https://beavo.com), the app is available for Android and iOS, I did for a friend in exchange for a box of Lego during first few months of my sabbatical because she had the idea for an app for some time but nobody to help out with the development part and I had planned on learning how to build a web app using Javascript (React) and Capacitor to create an app for both mobile operating systems, but with a single codebase, so I thought hey instead of building some random prototype that will be useless besides learning how to do things why not use the time and actually create a real app

The second part of my sabbatical I used it to slow down a bit and enjoy life but I also kept reading tutorials and books about new technologies I had not yet been able to evaluate, watched videos on Youtube about web development and game development (using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/))

The third and final part of my sabbatical was to build the blog you are reading this article on right now and also wrote all the articles and tutorials that are published on this blog. I started learning how to do 3d animations with webgl, the one I finished is the header of this blog, click "Press start" to see what I ended up doing after a few weeks of learning and experimenting with react three fiber. I also enjoyed experimenting with the new Next.js 13 and 14 releases app router and React server components, learned more about MDX (markdown) content formatting and I also released two new opensource plugins during that time [remark-table-of-contents](https://github.com/chrisweb/remark-table-of-contents) and [rehype-github-alerts](https://github.com/chrisweb/rehype-github-alerts). I finally had time to rewrite and add new features to some of my previous projects like my opensource audio player [web-audio-api-player](https://github.com/chrisweb/web-audio-api-player) I had started coding back in the days when I was at jamendo, and which I now powering the jukebox on top of this blog, I helped fix bugs in opensource projects and their documentations, my latest PR for Next.js [Next.js PR #61412](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/61412) just got accepted a few days ago
