# About me

It's a me, ChrisWeb!

## Early Programming Days

As I described in my [games](/games) section, I started programming at a young age with an Amstrad CPC computer and because I loved to play games at some point I wondered if I could learn to make my own games 👾, so I bought my first programming books about making games in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) and started typing the several pages long examples from the book into files, I would then copy them to Floppy disks 😲 and share them with friends to see of they enjoyed playing them as much as I did

A few years later I got my first PC and started using [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)), I remember one of the first games I did on my own had very basic vector graphics and was a bit like an [Out Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run) game but in space, so instead of a car you were piloting a spaceship, you had to shoot and destroy incoming asteroids, I enjoyed programming it as well as playing it.

## First Website on GeoCities

When I got my second PC it came with a modem, which meant I now had access to internet, it was mind blowing

That's when I discovered that a new service had just been founded called [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities), little did I know that this was going to be the start of my web development journey. I started learning HTML and later [DHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_HTML), which consisted of learning how to use [&lt;blink&gt;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_element), `<center>` and how to add a small image (that repeats itself indefinitely) as background 😂. To get an idea of what we were building check out this [geocities archive](https://geocities.restorativland.org/).

## TombRaider.net and dropping out of school

I had read news in gaming magazines about an upcoming game called [Tomb Raider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_(1996_video_game)) starring [Lara Croft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Croft) a female Indiana Jones like character. It seemed to be a promising game and so I searched for available domains, of course tombraider.com had already been registered by the developers of the game, but I was extremely lucky to be able to register tombraider.net 🙂.

> [!NOTE]  
> I was able to find traces of my [tombraider.net website from april 1999](https://web.archive.org/web/20000510125725/http://www.tombraider.net/) in the [internet archive](https://archive.org/), but unfortunately none of the images got saved 😥

On tombraider.net I had a "music box" (similar to the jukebox I now have on this blog) but the music tracks were midi songs, back in the days you could use the `<embed>` element to add midi (.mid) music to your website, today browser don't support it anymore so I had to convert the songs to ogg / mp3 to be able to post them here. I was able to retrieve two Tomb Raider midi files from the internet archive, originally composed by [Nathan McCree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_McCree):

            </audio>

            <a href="/assets/music/tombraider_net/sound07.mid">Original midi file download</a>
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

Here is the third song I was able to retrieve, it is so melancholic, maybe I was anticipating what mood I would be in 20 years later when reviewing my past work:

<div className="grid">

            <a href="/assets/music/tombraider_net/sound02.mid">Original midi file download</a>
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

I even found a comment I was always putting in my code back in the days when I did use any IDE yet to write my HTML and javascript: `&lt;!-- MADE WITH NOTEPAD 1.0 --&gt;{:.comment}` 😋

The popularity of the website kept increasing and generating traffic. A year later, just before the release of the second Tomb Raider game, I got in contact with people from GX Media, an American start up operating gamers.com as well as GX Network, an advertising platform for gaming websites. After adding their banner code to tombraider.net I started getting checks every month.

Getting paid to create and operate a gaming website on my own was a dream come true. Because of that and because at that time web development wasn't really something you could learn at school I decided to drop out of high school during my final year. Yes my parents were less enthusiastic than I was, to say the least but they still supported me.

After the third Tomb Raider game the number of visits started dropping and so did the numbers on the checks.

## Nonprofit Work and Personal Challenges

Around that time I met some people that were active in Nonprofit organizations and they had planned to rent a house near where I was living to move in together and build a community of like-minded people. I decided to join them to create a Nonprofit organization so that I could contribute my skills in web development to help them promote their ideas. At first I used [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)) to create a no-code windows software that allowed non developers to organize content without having any HTML skills, when done a click on the publish button would convert the navigation and pages into HTML documents, ready to be published on a server. After a while I started using [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) to make the pages more dynamic and add tools like discussion boards to the pages.

This period included ups and downs, with financial struggles leading to a return to my parents home. Looking back I really enjoyed the years I had spent helping nonprofit organizations embrace the internet, but by the end I was depressed 😢 for not having been able to secure the required funding to continue

## Getting back up

I had lost some confidence in myself, but my passion for web development was intact, I spent my days expanding my skill set in various programming languages and web development tools. Here is what my bookshelves looked like at that time

<div className="grid">
    <div>
        ![my first bookshelf](../../public/assets/images/app/about_me/bookshelf_01.jpg '{ photo }')
    </div>
    <div>
        ![my second bookshelf](../../public/assets/images/app/about_me/bookshelf_02.jpg '{ photo }')
    </div>
</div>

My increased skill set is what eventually helped me to secure my first "real" job as web developer.

## The green triangle

My second job started with a very funny moment. At that time I was very interested in learning how to create better and more intuitive interfaces using HTML pages using CSS and Javascript. I applied for a web designer position at a big media house and the task during the interview was to build a website for a fictional gardening company called "the green triangle". My Photoshop skills clearly were not up to the task and my green triangle in the top right of the page led to both the interviewer and me laughing at the result. They were however impressed by the amount and quality of code I had written and asked me to apply again for another PHP developer position that had not been published yet, I applied the next week and this time I got the job.

I ended up working several years for Saint-Paul Luxembourg as a PHP developer. Even though the company was a big luxembourgish media house, the development team was small and had a familiar atmosphere. We worked hard during the day, but I also remember playing online video games with my teammates after work, which helped reduce our stress but also helped us get to know each other better. I spent a lot of my free time doing prototypes with PHP frameworks that were popular at that time, which helped me become a better developer and be knowledgeable when discussing such topics at work. I started as a junior developer sometimes wondering about the imposter syndrome that a lot of developers experience at one point in their career but I left as senior developer with increased confidence in my skills.

## Jamendo

At jamendo.com I started helping to transition the API backend to [Zend Framework](https://github.com/zendframework/zf1) and the frontend to [Backbone.js](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone). Later we transitioned the pages backend to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and the mobile apps to [Cordova](https://github.com/apache/cordova), which meant we were now able to use a single programming language ([typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)) and allowed us to reuse code from Server Side Rendering (SSR) in the client (browser) as well as in the mobile apps.

I was very interested in the product (I mean who doesn't like music 😉) and kept on bringing up ideas for new features, which is why after two years as a developer I switched to a product management / team leader role. We built a multi disciplinary team of not just developers but also designers and music managers, which worked together to rethink, rewrite and redesign most of Jamendo Music. One idea I was eager to try out was the concept of music communities so that instead of having only one global charts page on the homepage, we would also have dozens of music communities by music genre, where each one would have their own charts, curated playlists and trending section. Being an indie music platform meant we had to overcome challenges the other music platforms did not have. For example we knew that even a great search engine would not deliver a good UX, as searching mainstream artists would not yield the expected results. This is why we put a lot of effort into improving our ranking and similarity algorithms, better promoting the playlists of our music team as well as using the collective curation efforts of our community to help our users find music and artists they like.

We also did smaller adjustments like merging the like and bookmark buttons into a single ❤️ (heart) button to reduce UI clutter. We spent a lot of time creating prototypes, analyzing data from our current users and making google forms to gather feedback, so that we could make decisions based on numbers and not solely on our assumptions. During that period we learned valuable lessons about user engagement and product evolution.

## Clubee.com and COVID-19 Challenges

When I started at Clubee the biggest challenge was to move parts of the existing infrastructure to the cloud to help us reduce the amount of time spent dealing with devops tasks and be able to focus more on the development of new features. Another challenge was to imprve the developer experience (DX) to reduce the time needed to develop and release new features into production, which we achieved by improving our automatic deployment workflows, as well as upgrading our debugging and monitoring tools. I also spent some of my time helping the team choose the best technologies based on our needs, budget and the knowledge of the team members.

When the COVID-19 pandemic started to impact us all, it created new challenges we had to overcome. We were partially ready for remote work, but adapting to full time remote work and maintaining productivity by maintaining motivation was still a challenge. I worked on improving the way the team would communicate, do brainstorming sessions or have team meetings. Having worked a lot from home myself in the past I was able to give the team tips about how to create a daily routine, avoid potential distractions that are around you when working from home and also how to stay healthy and happy. A fun change we did was to transform our in person after work events into online events, which meant everyone in the team would prepare their favorite drink(s) and snack(s) and then join the others via webcam to play online games.

## Sabbatical and Current Projects

I have taken a sabbatical to update my skills once again but also to develop new projects, like an Android and iOS app called [Beavo](https://beavo.com), it is a web app for for Beach Volleyball players using [React](https://react.dev/) and [Capacitor.js](https://capacitorjs.com/), that I did for a friend. I used Xcode Cloud to create a CI/CD pipeline that will automatically build the app and distribute it to testers, each time there is a new pull request into the GitHub repository.

I rebuilt my personal blog using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and focused on [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (markdown) content formatting to create a static blog, which lead to the creation of 2 new open source plugins [remark-table-of-contents](https://github.com/chrisweb/remark-table-of-contents) and [rehype-github-alerts](https://github.com/chrisweb/rehype-github-alerts). I also updated my [web-audio-api-player](https://github.com/chrisweb/web-audio-api-player) project which is powering the jukebox on top of this blog and had a lot of fun working on the header ("Press Start" in the top header to see the animation) using [React-three-fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) a React renderer for three.js (WebGL).

I read countless articles and watched educational videos on YouTube about about web development and game development (using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)) and contributed to open-source projects on GitHub, fixing bugs and helping improve documentation, for example latest PR for Next.js [Next.js PR #61412](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/61412) just got accepted recently
