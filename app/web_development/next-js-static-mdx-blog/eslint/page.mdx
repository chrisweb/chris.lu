# ESLint

before we get started here are a few things that are worth knowing:

Next.js has two packages that are related to ESLint:

- [eslint-config-next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-next)
- [eslint-plugin-next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/eslint-plugin-next)

**eslint-config-next** is a package that bundles multiple plugins, it intends to make it easier to get started with ESLint and it will install the following 3 plugins for you:

- [eslint-plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react)
- [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)
- [eslint-plugin-next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/eslint-plugin-next)

**eslint-plugin-next** is the actual ESLint plugin for Nextjs (called **@next/eslint-plugin-next** on npmjs), it aims to catch common issues and problems in a Nextjs application

for a full list of rules that the ESLint plugin will add check out the [Nextjs "ESLint rules" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint#eslint-plugin) or have a look at the [eslint-plugin-next rules directory on github](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/eslint-plugin-next/src/rules)

## installing eslint

you have 4 options when it comes to installing ESLint in a Nextjs project

Note: spoiler alert I will use option 4 for this project, but feel free to read about the first 3 options so that you know what is possible and then chose for yourself which one you like best

- option 1: you use [create-next-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-next-app) and when asked about installing eslint you select **YES** to install ESLint
- option 2: you use **create-next-app** but when asked about installing ESLint you select **NO**, but later Nextjs cli linting script `npm run lint` (which will install eslint if it did not get installed yet)
- option 3: we will NOT use **create-next-app** at all, instead we will manually create an ESLint configuration file and install **eslint-config-next** manually, which will automatically install the 3 plugins (eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-react-hooks and eslint-plugin-next) for us
- option 4: we will do a fully manual installation of everything needed to lint both our code and MDX content (we will include **eslint-plugin-next**, but we will NOT use **create-next-app** or the **eslint-config-next** package)

### option 1:

- use the following command `npx create-next-app@latest` to run create-next-app
- when you get asked "Would you like to use ESLint?" choose "YES"
- **create-next-app** will install **eslint-config-next** (as seen above eslint-config-next will install the 3 plugins eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-react-hooks and eslint-plugin-next)
- then create-next-app will create a `.eslintrc.json` file in the root of the project, create-next-app will automatically use the "strict" mode, which means it will **extend** next/core-web-vitals, which is a rule-set containing stricter "core web vitals" rules
- create-next-app will also add the following line `"lint": "next lint"` to your package.json `scripts`, which means if that you now can use the command `npm run lint` it will execute `next lint` which is the Nextjs cli command for linting

### option 2:

- use the following command `npx create-next-app@latest` to run create-next-app
- when you get asked "Would you like to use ESLint?" choose "NO"
- even if you choose to NOT install ESLint via create-next-app, it will still add the following line `"lint": "next lint"` to your package.json `scripts`, which means that if you now can use the command `npm run lint` it will execute `next lint` which is the nextjs cli command for linting because it is the first time you run this command and it can't find an eslint configuration file it will suggest you create one
- when using npm run lint, you will get asked if you want to use the **strict** mode (which includes the "core web vitals" rule-set) or the **base** eslint rule-sets, after that **eslint** and **eslint-config-next** will get installed for you
- the script should also create an eslintrc file for you, but currently (16.10.2023) doesn't due to a bug: [Nextjs GitHub issue #55102 (next eslint .eslintrc.json file not being created)](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/55102)

### option 3:

- run the following command to install **eslint-config-next** manually `npm i eslint eslint-config-next --save-dev --save-exact`
- now also need to create an `.eslintrc.json` file (if you haven't already created one manually before) in the root of the project
- next, if you wish to use the eslint-config-next **strict** mode (including the "core web vitals" rule-set) add this to your eslint configuration file `"extends": "next/core-web-vitals"` or if you prefer to use the **base** mode add this to your eslint configuration file `"extends": "next"`, make sure the extends for nextjs is always last (after other configurations that you might be have added in your eslint extends)

Note: as mentioned in the [nextjs "configuring ESLint" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/eslint) it is important that **next/core-web-vitals** is last in the list of extended configurations to ensure none of their configurations get overwritten by another configuration that comes after

the package.json will not have a linting command (because we did not use create-next-app), so we need to add the following line `"lint": "next lint"` to our package.json `scripts` to enable linting via the next cli, if we use **next lint** it will lint the default nextjs directories (as of now `ESLINT_DEFAULT_DIRS = ['app', 'pages', 'components', 'lib', 'src']`), but you can manually change that list using the `--dir` flag, to specify which files should get linted you can use the `--file` flag, you can also use the next lint option `--no-cache` to disable caching files into the directory `.next/cache`

### option 4:

#### create an eslintrc file

first, we configure ESLint using their configuration tool, using this command:

```shell
npm init @eslint/config
```

chose the options you like best, I for my part chose the following:

- how would you like to use eslint: check syntax, find problems and enforce code style
- what type of modules does your project use: javascript (import/export)
- which framework does your project use: react
- does your project use typescript: yes
- where does your project run: press the "a" key to have both selected, "browser" and "node"
- how would you like to define a style for your project: you can select "use a popular style guide" and eslint will let you choose between ["standard"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-standard-with-typescript) and ["XO"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-xo), check out their repositories if you want to know more about what configuration they apply, I for my part prefer to answer some questions to set my own rules and also because in the next step we will extend the next.js ESLint configuration
- what format do you want your config to be in: I like to use javascript configuration files over json as it allows me to leave comments for myself and other developers that might come after me if I wish to do so, so I chose "javascript"
- what style of indentation do you use: I have always used 4 spaces, so I will stick to this, some prefer 2 spaces others prefer tabs these days, there is no right or wrong here, choose what you like best
- what quotes do you use for strings: I always use single quotes, I don't use double quotes in JS and I reserve them for HTML attributes
- what line endings do you use: I chose Windows as I'm on Windows, I don't think it doesn't matter much, because when you commit to GitHub they will get converted anyway, ["for compatibility, line endings are converted to Unix style when you commit files"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings#about-line-endings), also if you want to know more about line endings I recommend reading this article ["Dealing with line endings in Windows with Git and ESLint"](https://markoskon.com/line-endings-in-vscode-with-git-and-eslint/)
- do you require semicolons: I don't anymore, less to code is a win for me, but I know it can cause problems as there are some places where they are mandatory, like between statements in a **for loop**, but in all these years finding those few exceptions has not been a problem

now eslint init has created a `.eslintrc.js` configuration file for us

#### package.json scripts lint command using **next lint**

when using option 4, the package.json will not have a linting command, because we did not use create-next-app (which adds that command to your package.json scripts for you)

this is why we need to add the following line `"lint": "next lint"` to our package.json `scripts` to enable linting by using the `next lint` command of the next cli

#### **next lint** command flags

if we use **next lint** it will lint the default nextjs directories (as of now `ESLINT_DEFAULT_DIRS = ['app', 'pages', 'components', 'lib', 'src']`)

but you can manually change that list using the `--dir` flag to specify which files should get linted you can use the `--file` flag

you can also use the next lint option `--no-cache` to discable caching files into the directory `.next/cache`

read more:

- [next lint "linting custom directories" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/eslint#linting-custom-directories-and-files)
- [next lint "no cache flag" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/eslint#caching)

#### **eslint** cli

an alternative if you need more control over the lint command, is to NOT use **next lint** but instead use the **eslint cli** and create a custom linting command `npx eslint <baseDir> [options]`

##### **eslint** cli flags

Note: when using **next lint** cli, several things were done for us in the background, however as we want to use the eslint cli we need to set those flags ourself

to enable eslint cache we need to use the option `--cache` and then we tell eslint to use the same cache directory that next lint would use like so:

```shell
npx eslint ./ --cache-location .next/cache/eslint
```

To specify what files (extensions) get linted we need will use the ext flag like so:

```shell
npx eslint ./ --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx,.mdx,.md
```

another advantage of using the eslint cli is that (unlike next lint) it lets you use the `--debug` flag to get a verbose output of what eslint does:

```shell
npx eslint ./ --debug
```

the full eslint command with all the flags set, looks like this:

```shell
npx eslint ./ --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx,.mdx,.md --cache-location .next/cache/eslint
```

read more:

- [ESLint "command line" documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/command-line-interface)

#### **npm run lint** command with eslint cli

you can of course run this command manually but we want to be able to keep using our `npm run lint` command as we did before, this is why we will add the eslint command to our package.json scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
    "lint": "npx eslint ./ --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx,.mdx,.md --cache --cache-location .next/cache/eslint",
    "lint-debug": "npx eslint ./ --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx,.mdx,.md --cache --cache-location .next/cache/eslint --debug"
}
```

we also created a second command called **lint-debug** using the `--debug` to do a linting with a verbose output in case we want to analyze a linting problem

#### next build does not use `npm run lint`

when doing a build (to deploy next.js) it will start by launching a linting process, unfortunatly Next.js will use its own **next lint** cli command to automatically lint the code during a build process, but it will NOT do so by using **lint** command you have defined in your package.json **scripts**

we however want builds to use the lint command from package.json scripts (because we have customized it to use the eslint cli instead of the next lint cli), this is why we need to do two things:

- disable automatic linting during builds
- create a new build command in the scripts of our package.json that will use instead of next build

to disable linting by nextjs during builds we need to add the following few lines to our next.config.js like so: 

```mjs
module.exports = {
  eslint: {
    // Warning: This allows production builds to successfully complete even if
    // your project has ESLint errors.
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
}
```

now nextjs will NOT automatically lint during builds anymore, but we still want linting to happen during builds, this is why we are now going to add `npm run lint` to the package.json **build** script like so:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "npm run lint && next build",
    "lint": "npx eslint ./ --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx,.mdx,.md --cache --cache-location .next/cache/eslint"
},
```

the updated **build** command will execute our lint script and if there is an error it will stop there, if there is no linting error it will go on and also build the project

Note: platforms like Vercel will use the package.json build script by executing the command `npm run build`, which means that if your linting fails then the deployment on vercel will get aborted










- option 4: you don't install **eslint-config-next** at all, but instead you install the 3 plugins manually (eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-react-hooks and eslint-plugin-next) yourself and then manually create an eslint configuration file
  - run the following command to install **eslint-plugin-next** and the other plugins manually `npm i eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks @next/eslint-plugin-next --save-dev --save-exact`
  - add the recommended rule-sets for each plugin via extends to our `.eslintrc` file
    - adding `plugin:react/recommended` will add the recommended rule-set for the eslint-plugin-react
    - adding `plugin:@next/next/recommended` will add the base rule-set for eslint-plugin-react
    - adding `plugin:@next/next/core-web-vitals` will additionnally also add some more rules related to "core-web-vitals"







- if you use this option there is a lot more fine tuning you might want to apply to the eslint configuration file, for example, the eslint-plugin-react recommends you set the `"ecmaFeatures": { "jsx": true }` in the `parserOptions` and in `settings` you should set `"react": { "version": "detect" },` (you can also check in the package.json what react version you are using and set it to that instead of using "detect"), ... I will not further explain every tweak that can be made as this would go far beyond the goals of this tutorial, but I highly recommend you check out the [eslint-plugin-react readme](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react#readme) and [eslint-plugin-react-hooks readme](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/README.md) if you want to learn more


Note: option 4 gives you full control over what gets installed, what version of each plugin gets used and you can configure each plugin how you want, but this is also clearly more work (and will probably increase your maintenance costs), so if you don't need to configure every detail of every plugin manually and if you don't use custom overrides then I recommend using one of the first 3 options instead (if you use option 1, 2 or 3 you can still extend add plugins manually or change the eslint configuration at a later point in time)

For this project I will choose option 4, it can be used when creating a new project and works well if you intend to upgrade a project using an older version of nextjs where you already have an eslint configuration file

another reason I chose option 4, is that 

 also has the benefit that it can be used when you need to create a custom **overrides**, which is the case if you want to lint two different types of files using different plugins and rules

        indent: [
            'error',
            4,
        ],
        quotes: [
            'error',
            'single',
        ],

            'error',
            'never',
        ],
        '@typescript-eslint/naming-convention': [
            'error',
            {
                'selector': 'interface',
                'format': [
                    'PascalCase'
                ],
                'custom': {
                    'regex': '^I[A-Z]',
                    'match': true
                },
            }
        ],
    },
}
```

## installing the @typescript-eslint parser + plugin

### customizing @typescript-eslint plugin rules

finally, you can now add your own custom rules to the eslint configuration, for example always like to add a custom rule, to ensure all my typescript interfaces start with a big "i", I find this helpful when they get imported later on, to distinguish them from regular functions and variables, if you wish to do so, add the following code in the "rules" section of your `.eslintrc.js`:

```mjs
module.exports = {
rules: {
    '@typescript-eslint/naming-convention': [
        'error',
        {
            'selector': 'interface',
            'format": [
                'PascalCase'
            ],
            'custom': {
                'regex': '^I[A-Z]',
                'match': true
            }
        }
    ],
}
}
```

after setting the custom rule **@typescript-eslint/naming-convention** I got the following error:

> Error while loading rule '@typescript-eslint/naming-convention': You have used a rule which requires parserServices to be generated. You must therefore provide a value for the "parserOptions.project" property for @typescript-eslint/parser.

To fix this (as suggested by the error message) we set the **parserOptions.project** property in our eslintrc file:

```mjs
parserOptions: {
    project: './tsconfig.json'
},
```



## 

in this MDX blog tutorial the goal is to lint both our typescript (javascript) files but also also our MDX files

Note: it would be nice to be able to use the the nextjs **eslint-config-next** package that already has an ESLint "overrides" set up for the typescript files and only add a second **overrides** for MDX files

however if you create a custom eslintrc and add on overrides for MDX and then use **eslint-config-next**, it will  not use the overrides you set in your custom eslint, however this is currently not possible, there is open ticket regarding that limitation: [next lint command doesn't support overrides #35228](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/35228)

this is why we will create two overrides:

- one overrides for typescript using a typescript parser as well as a bunch of plugins to lint typescript, react, next.js and more, that will replace the **next-lint** overrides
- a second overrides for our MDX files that will use remark as parser and add a bunch of remark



```mjs
    overrides: [
        {
            files: ['**/*.ts?(x)'],
            extends: [
                'eslint:recommended',
                'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',
                'plugin:@next/next/recommended',
            ],
            parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
            parserOptions: {
                sourceType: 'module',
                ecmaFeatures: {
                    jsx: true,
                },
                warnOnUnsupportedTypeScriptVersion: true,

            },
            rules: {
                // Indentation BUG: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16385
                /*
                indent: [
                    'error',
                    4,
                ],*/
                quotes: [
                    'error',
                    'single',
                ],
                semi: [
                    'error',
                    'never',
                ],
                '@typescript-eslint/naming-convention': [
                    'error',
                    {
                        'selector': 'interface',
                        'format': [
                            'PascalCase',
                        ],
                        'custom': {
                            'regex': '^I[A-Z]',
                            'match': true,
                        },
                    }
                ],
            },
        },
    ],
```
      
now that we have created our overrides for ts(x) files it does not make much sense to keep using the eslint-config-next package, the [nextjs "migrating eslint" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/eslint#migrating-existing-config) mentions that if you customize the parserOptions then just extend the eslint-plugin-next instead of the package eslint-config-next, so that's what we will do now:

TODO: because we are not using **eslint-config-next** besides the eslint overrides there are some things that the config did for us and that we need to add to our setup:

install and configure
eslint-plugin-react
eslint-plugin-react-hooks

## eslint-plugin-mdx

### eslint-plugin-mdx installation

Note: I have a chapter about [installing & setting up eslint](#eslint-installation-and-setup) for the project and VSCode, if you skipped that earlier you might want to read it now before adding the eslint mdx plugin

There is an eslint mdx plugin called [eslint-plugin-mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-mdx) that I recommend installing first, as it will help us write find and fix problems in our mdx content

Note: if you go to the [ESLint MDX GitHub repository](https://github.com/mdx-js/eslint-mdx), you will see they have two packages, **eslint-mdx** which is the parser and **eslint-plugin-mdx** which is the actual eslint plugin, you don't need to install the parser manually, so it is in the plugins package json and will be installed when you install the plugin

to install the mdx plugin we use this command:

```shell
npm i eslint-plugin-mdx --save-dev --save-exact
```

### eslint-plugin-mdx configuration

when using the MDX eslint plugin we want it to only check mdx files, so as stated in the [eslint-plugin-mdx readme](https://github.com/mdx-js/eslint-mdx#notice) it is very important to use the overrides feature of ESLint, if you want to know more about the parsing issues you might have if not using overrides check out the [eslint-plugin-mdx GitHub issue #251](https://github.com/mdx-js/eslint-mdx/issues/251#issuecomment-736139224)

```json
{
    overrides: [
        {
            files: ['*.mdx'],
            extends: 'plugin:mdx/recommended',
            settings: {
                'mdx/code-blocks': true,
            },
        },
    ],
}
```

### eslint-plugin-mdx customizing rules

## remark-lint

### remark-lint installation

### remark-lint configuration

Note: after changing values in the remarkrc file, you need to manually restart the eslint server as eslint will NOT automatically detect and reload after you made changes in the remarkrc file

### remark-lint disabling warnings

to disable a remark-lint rule just set it to false (which I did for the first two rules):

```mjs
// https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-lint-maximum-line-length
['remark-lint-maximum-line-length', false],
// https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-lint-list-item-spacing
['remark-lint-list-item-spacing', false],
```

another warning I got was:

> MD028/no-blanks-blockquote: Blank line inside blockquotemarkdownlintMD028

as stated in the documentation, this rule exists because:

> Some Markdown parsers will treat two blockquotes separated by one or more blank lines as the same blockquote

I checked if this is the case with **@next/mdx** ...

TODO: finish this part

### remark-eslint customizing warnings

rules can be customized via options, for the third rule **remark-lint-maximum-heading-length** I set the maximum length to be 48 characters, meaning that if one of my headings is 49 or more characters long then remark will warn me about it

```mjs
// https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-lint-maximum-heading-length
['remark-lint-maximum-heading-length', [1, 48]],
```

## adding an eslint test page

## linting your code via the command line

if you now want to lint your code, just run the following command

```shell
npm run lint
```

if you used eslint before you might have used [eslint cli options](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface), next lint supports some of these too

which means that if in the past you did, something like this:

```shell
npx eslint ./ --fix
```

then you can still do the same with "next lint", like so:

```shell
npm run lint --fix
```

Note: if you look at the code of linting cli from the next.js package, you can see which eslint options next.js supports ["cli/next-lint.ts"](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/cli/next-lint.ts#L63)

## linting as you code using ESLint VSCode extensions

there are two VSCode extensions you probably want to install (if your IDE is VSCode), the benefit is that linting will be done in realtime in VSCode as you write your code, if there is a problem it will be underlined and if you hover over the underlined code you will see a tooltip telling you what problem eslint found, this means your code gets linted as you write it and not just when you run the lint command

### VSCode eslint extension

[VSCode eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

to check if eslint is running, press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` to open the command palette, then type **eslint** and choose "ESLint: Show Output Channel", which will open the output channel and show you a message like

{/* lint ignore no-undefined-references */}
> [Info  - 8:41:03 PM] ESLint server is running.

if you see that line it means the ESLint server is running in your workspace

to change the eslint extension settings, click on the "Extensions" icon on the right or press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `X` and then click on the gear icon (⚙️) and then in the menu select **Extension Settings**

Note: when you edit settings you can do it on a **User** level or **Workspace** level, user level means the settings will get applied to whatever project is open in VSCode (which can be interesting if all your projects are written in the same programming language and you only want to configure extensions for all of them at once), workspace level means the settings will only apply to the current workspace (the currently open project), I like to set the options on a workspace level because this creates a settings.json file inside a **.vscode** directory in the root of my project, I can then commit that directory alongside my project files, so that when someone else does a checkout the will have the settings for VSCode too, but you could also add a note about the settings and what extensions should get installed in your project README for example

this is what my `.vscode/settings.json` looks like for the nextjs / mdx blog:

```json
{
    "eslint.debug": true,
    "eslint.options": {
        "extensions": [
            ".js",
            ".jsx",
            ".md",
            ".mdx",
            ".ts",
            ".tsx"
        ]
    },
    "eslint.validate": [
        "markdown",
        "mdx",
        "javascript",
        "javascriptreact",
        "typescript",
        "typescriptreact"
    ]
}
```

#### restart the eslint server in VSCode

- press `ctrl` + `shift` + `p` to open the command palette
- then enter "ESLint" and choose the command called **ESLint: Restart ESLint Server**

### VSCode language support extension for MDX

Note: I have a chapter about the [VSCode eslint extension](#vscode-eslint-extension), if you skipped it earlier you might want to read it now before adding the VSCode MDX extension

I recommend installing [VSCode language support extension for MDX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) when working with MDX content as this extension will add IntelliSense support for MDX files to VSCode

Note: this extension is still experimental, but I had no problems when using it

## disabling rules (warnings) using comments

sometimes you might encounter warnings that you want to suppress because it is an exception to the rule (but you don't want to disable the rule completely in your configuration), then you can use comments to disable the rule for example for an entire file or just the next line

### eslint "disable rule(s)" comment

disabling an eslint rule for the next line (works for plugins too, except remark, see below):

```ts
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
const foo = 'bar'
```

read more:

- [eslint "disabling rules using comments" documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#disabling-rules)

### remark-lint "ignore warnings" comments

disabling a remark lint warning for the next line

in markdown files it can be done using html comments:

```md
<!--lint ignore no-undefined-references-->

> [Info  - 8:41:03 PM] ESLint server is running.
```

Note: For HTML comments in markdown files you need to have a blank line between the comment and markdown

in MDX files it can be done using mdx comments:

```mdx
{/* lint ignore no-undefined-references */}
> [Info  - 8:41:03 PM] ESLint server is running.
```

## transitioning to flat config files

as of now (06.11.2023) you can still use eslintrc configuration files, but it will be deprecated in ESLint >= 9.0.0, as ESLint mentions in their documentation:

> We are transitioning to a new config system in ESLint v9.0.0. The config system shared on this page is currently the default but will be deprecated in v9.0.0. You can opt-in to the new config system by following the instructions in the documentation.

support for [eslintrc configuration files will be removed in version 10.0.0](https://eslint.org/blog/2023/10/flat-config-rollout-plans/#eslintrc-removed-in-eslint-v10.0.0)

### flat config files

the new config system called ESLint **flat config files** is the future of configuring eslint

Note: in early 2019 ESLint released an [RFC for flat config files](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/tree/main/designs/2019-config-simplification), it is a fresh start for how ESLint gets configured, that hopefully to simplify the ESLint configuration process, for example today there is only one configuration in an eslintrc and hence only one **files** pattern can be defined, if you need more you have to use overrides, the new system however gets rid of overrides and instead allows you to create multiple configurations, each one having it's own **files** pattern and each own plugins, rules, ...

**flat config files** will be [the new default configuration system](https://eslint.org/blog/2023/10/flat-config-rollout-plans/#main) starting with version 9.0.0

the first ESLint version that has support for [flat config files is ESLint v8.21.0](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/eslint-v8.21.0-released/) but newer versions got released since that have brought fixes and improvements

TODO: snippets backup, do I need this or delete:

If you already have ESLint configured in your application, we recommend extending from this plugin directly instead of including eslint-config-next

**eslint-config-next**

because we don't use next lint, the node_modules directory is probably going to be linted, so the node_modules directory needs to get excluded (to check this add .js extension to eslint cli command)
