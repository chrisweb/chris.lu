# Node.js

## Installation


## Did you know?

### Node.js now has built-in .env file support

One of the first dependencies developers usually add to their Node.js project is [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), but since v20.6.0 Node.js has [built-in .env file support](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V20.md#built-in-env-file-support), so you might not need an extra package anymore

If you use the following command:

```shell
node --env-file=config.env index.js
```

and this is the content of your **config.env**:

```ini
FOO='bar'
```

then in your code you can the following line to retrieve the value:

```js
let foo = process.env.FOO
```
