# Node.js

![a waterfall of code with the text node.js](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/node-js/banner.png '{ banner }')

When [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) first showed up, most people were probably using PHP, Java or Ruby as backend language. **Node.js** gave us the possibility to use Javascript outside a web browser, meaning that for the first time we could use the same language for backend as well as frontend code. If you add other tools like [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) or [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) to your stack and you can use Javascript for your desktop and mobile apps too. It will never be possible to have a fully Isomorphic cross platform codebase, but by using Node.js you can reuse some of your Javascript code.

> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript 

Under the hood, Node.js uses the Chrome (chromium) [V8 engine](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/the-v8-javascript-engine), meaning it is based on the same asynchronous, event-driven model that Chrome uses. Still, there are differences. If you would like to learn more about those differences, check out the Node.js article [Differences between Node.js and the Browser](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/differences-between-nodejs-and-the-browser).

The significant advantage when using Node.js is that web applications can be written using a single programming language rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts. If later you also use other tools like [capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) or [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), then you will be able to go a step further and create mobile and desktop apps for your project and still use Javascript as the only programming language, which also means that a lot of the code you wrote can be shared between the backend, frontend and even your apps.

## Installation

There are several options when it comes to installing Node.js. The first option is to use an installer for a specific version of Node.js, which is a good solution if you install Node.js on a server. The second option uses a Node version manager to install Node.js, which is usually a better solution for your local machine as it has the advantage that you can install several versions of Node.js in parallel on your computer. Using a Node version manager, depending on which project you work on, you can switch between versions (for example, you might want to use the latest version of Node.js for a personal project and have another LTS version of Node.js installed in parallel for a work-related project)

* Head over to the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and download the latest LTS version for your operating system (OS). On Mac OS X, you can also use brew to install Node.js using this command `brew install node`
* Alternatively, use a Node version manager to install Node.js. If you are on Windows have a look at [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). For Mac OS X, check out [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Linux distributions, check out [NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions). For a more complete list of options, check out the [npm.js "download and install Node.js" documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) page

### Should I install the LTS or the current version

It depends ðŸ˜‰

If you go to the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download), you will see that Node.js different versions: some are labeled as **LTS** and others are labeled **Current**

* LTS stands for **Long Term Support**, and this version is recommended for production deployments. A LTS version is considered **stable**, meaning it will not receive the latest features from the current version, but on the other hand it also means you can do updates without the fear of installing a version containing breaking changes. After an LTS version got release any critical bugs will be fixed for a total of 30 months
* The current version is more modern, but some newer features are likely to change, so if you want to try out the latest features before a Node.js version moves to the LTS phase, then the current version is the one you should download

## Checking the current Node.js version

You can use the following command in the VSCode terminal (or your favorite command line tool) to check which version of Node.js is currently installed:

```shell
node -v
```

## Checking if your current Node.js is still secure

Sometimes you wonder if you need to update Node.js on your server(s) to fix a security flaw or if you can continue to use the current version (for another ten years ðŸ˜‰)

The Node.js team member has released a little tool called [is-my-node-vulnerable](https://github.com/RafaelGSS/is-my-node-vulnerable), all you need to do is run this command:

```shell
npx is-my-node-vulnerable
```

To learn more about what it does and especially how it does it, I recommend checking out the projects [README](https://github.com/RafaelGSS/is-my-node-vulnerable), to give you an idea of what it does I will quote a few lines from their README:

> **is-my-node-vulnerable** helps ensure the security of your Node.js installation by checking for known vulnerabilities.
>  
> It compares the version of Node.js you have installed (process.version) to the [Node.js Security Database](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/tree/main/vuln) and alerts you if a vulnerability is found.

## Node.js alternatives

If, for some reason, you are unhappy with Node.js or are just curious and want to know more about alternatives, then I recommend checking out the following two JavaScript runtimes:

* [Deno](https://deno.com/)

> Deno is a JavaScript runtime that prioritizes productivity, security, and performance. Key features include built-in TypeScript, JSX, formatter, linter, and testing tools. Deno also supports creating standalone executables.

* [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

> Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript toolkit and runtime designed for speed. It includes a bundler, a test runner, and a Node.js-compatible package manager.

## Did you know?

### Node.js now has built-in .env file support

One of the first dependencies developers usually add to their Node.js project is [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), but since v20.6.0 Node.js has [built-in .env file support](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V20.md#built-in-env-file-support), so you might not need an extra package anymore

If you use the following command:

```shell
node --env-file=config.env index.js
```

And this is the content of your **config.env** you have:

```ini
FOO='bar'
```

Then, in your code, you can use the **environment variable** like this:

```js
let foo = process.env.FOO
```
