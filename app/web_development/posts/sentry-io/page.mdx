Sentry.io is a cloud-based error monitoring service that helps developers by captureing and logging errors (including stack traces and request information) in real-time (when they occur in production). They support via a wide range of languages and frameworks through their ["sentry-*" opensource SDKs](https://github.com/getsentry) that are hosted on GitHub. Beyond error tracking, Sentry also offers [performance monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance) features as well as a feature called [Sessions Replays](https://sentry.io/for/session-replay/) which lets you capture and then replay the user interactions that happend prior to the error occuring, making it easier to reproduce an error and more.

Sentry.io has a (free) [Developer](https://sentry.io/pricing/) plan, for developers that want to start a side project or just experiment with the service, it includes logs for up to 5000 errors, 10k performance metrics and more
