**Vercel.com** is a cloud platform that automates building, deploying, and scaling of your Javascript project. Vercel can be set up to watch your GitHub repository and every time you merge a pull request it can trigger a new build process. When the build process is done it will automatically deploy the code (depending on the branch it will either deploy it as a staging or production version).
