# VSCode

![banner image displaying a woman wearing a vscode t-shirt and writing code](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/banner.png)

**VSCode** (Visual Studio Code) is a versatile Integrated Development Environment (IDE) we will use to write our Javascript / Typescript code. I like VSCode because it has a lot of great features like smart code completion called [Intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense), code [refactoring](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring)...

VSCode also comes with great [debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) tools, meaning you can debug your frontend but also backend code within VSCode, for example managing breakpoints is very similar to how debugging works in the chrome developer tools. The [VSCode debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) launch configuration json file makes it very easy to adapt the debugger to any project and the debugger launch.json can then be shared as part of your git repository to make it very easy for other developers that will work on your project and that also use VSCode to use the debugger without having to configure it themself 

What is also great is that it has [integrated source control (git) support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview), staging, switching between branches and pushing are all things supported by VSCode, meaning we will be able to push our commits directly to github from within VSCode with just one click. It also makes resolving of conflicts and merging very easy using it's visual diff (as opposed to using git in the terminal (command line) which is another option if this is what you prefer).

VSCode also has an [extensions (plugins) marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace), which means that if one feature is not in VSCode core you will probably find an extension that suits your needs.

> [!NOTE]  
> VSCode the project is opensource and everyone can access and contribute to it source code in the [VSCode GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). The source code is licensed using the MIT license. VSCode the build that you download from Microsoft uses the [Microsoft Software License](https://code.visualstudio.com/license). It is similar to Chrome (not opensource) being the Chromium (opensource) build from Google, which contains propritary pieces, like the chrome logo image, but also pre installed extensions or codecs that are not part of chromium the fully opensource variant. So if you want an opensource version of the VSCode build you could check out [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) instead

## Installation

Head over to the [VSCode download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and download the latest version for your operating system (OS)

## Turn on settings sync (using your GitHub account)

click on the **Accounts** icon on the left in the **Activity bar** (if you have already customized VSCode, your Activity bar might be in another location)

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_activity_bar_accounts_icon.png)

* now click on **Backup and Sync Settings...**
* then on top center of your VSCode click on the **Sign in**
* then chose the option **Sign in with GitHub**
* this will open a window in your default browser, login to your GitHub account via the web (if you are not already logged in)
* after you have logged, the second step on GitHub will ask you to **Authorize GitHub for VS Code** (if you haven't already done so previously), click on the green **Authorize Visual-Studio-Code** button to accept
* then a modal box will appear in your browser asking you to open VSCode again (now that the GitHub login and authorization process is done this will bring you back into VSCode)
* that's it, you have connected your GitHub account in VSCode

If this is the first time you install VSCode, you will see a modal box pop up in the right corner to ask you if you want to sync your settings in the cloud, click on the **Turn on Settings Sync...** button, doing so will allow VSCode to synchronise your VSCode settings accross multiple devices (for example between your desktop computer and your laptop)

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_synchronize_settings.png)

## Cloning your GitHub repository in VSCode

There are several ways to clone a git (GitHub) repository in VSCode, I will describe 2 that are simple and very similar and make use of the integrated VSCode source control tool and then 1 using the VSCode Terminal, this is a bit more complex but if you prefer doing things manually via the command line than this third option is for you

Option 1 (via the **welcome** screen):

* if you just opened VSCode you will see a **welcome** screen, click on **Clone git repository...**

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_welcome_screen_clone_repository.png)

Option 2 (via the **Source Control** tool):

* click on the **Source Control** icon on the left in the **Activity bar** (if you have already customized VSCode, your Activity bar might be in another location) or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+G` (macOS: `⇧⌘G`, Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+G`)

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_activity_bar_source_control_icon.png)

* then click on **Clone Repository**

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_clone_repository.png)

Option 1 & 2 next steps:

* then click on **Clone from GitHub**

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_clone_from_github.png)

**If you are not yet logged in with your GitHub account yet:**

* VSCode will ask you to allow sign you in with GitHub:

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_github_extension_sign_in_modal.png)

* click on the **Allow** button
* this will open a window in your default browser, login to your GitHub account via the web (if you are not already logged in)
* after you have logged, the second step on GitHub will ask you to **Authorize GitHub for VS Code** (if you haven't already done so previously), click on the green **Authorize Visual-Studio-Code** button to accept
* then a modal box will appear in your browser asking you to open VSCode again (now that the GitHub login and authorization process is done this will bring you back into VSCode)

**As soon as you are logged in with your GitHub account:**

* in VSCode on top you will now see a list of all your GitHub repositories, select your repository from the list
* now chose a local directory in which you will save the clone of your repository (something like /users/YOUR_USERNAME/my_github_projects, no need to create a directory with the project name, VSCode will do that when cloning the repository), then click on **Select as Repository Destination**
* then in the bottom right you will see a modal box showing you that the cloning process is underway
* when the cloning is done VSCode will ask you if you want to open the cloned repository, click on **Open** to open it in the current VSCode or click on **Open in New Window** to open another VSCode instance

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_open_cloned_repository_modal.png)

* next (if you are not trusting that directory yet) you will see the following modal box asking you **do you trust the authors of the files in this directory**, because all the projects in parent directory are our own, we will check the box next to **Trust the authors...** and then click on **Yes, I trust the authors** (if it is a third party project you are cloning then the VSCode recommends to not trust it and only enable those extra features if you really need them, also if you clone third party projects it is recommended to store them in another directory than your own, of course all the usual security recommendations to protect your computer apply, like ensure you have an antivirus installed, ...)

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_trust_file_authors_modal.png)

> [!TIP]  
> to learn more about the I recommend to read the [VSCode "Workspace Trust" documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust)

that's finally it, congratulations you now have a local copy of your GitHub repository

Option 3 (via the VSCode terminal / or your preferred command line tool):

* the third option is to visit [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* then on top right click on your Avatar image
* in the side menu click on **Your repositories**
* then click on the name of your repository
* now on the top right of your repository page there is a green dropdown button labelled **Code**
* click on it and then click on the **HTTPS** tab
* copy the **https** URL
* now go back to VSCode
* open a terminal view, if you don't know how check out the [VSCode terminal](#open-a-vscode-terminal) chapter and if you prefer to use another command line tool feel free to do that
* go into the directory in which you want to store a local copy of your projects, for example by using this command: `cd MY_PATH_TO_MY_REPOSITORIES`
* then type the following command to clone the repository: `git clone THE_REPOSITORY_URL_YOU_COPIED_ON_GITHUB`
* now click on the **Source Control** icon on the left in the **Activity bar** (if you have already customized VSCode, your Activity bar might be in another location) or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+G` (macOS: `⇧⌘G`, Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+G`)
* then click on **Open Folder** and select the folder into which you just cloned your repository

> [!MORE]  
> [VSCode "git source control" documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git)  

## open a folder in VSCODE

* Open VSCode
* On the welcome screen click on **Open Folder**, if you have no welcome screen, you can also on top click on **File** and then **Open Folder**, another option to open a folder is to use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+O` (macOS: `⌘O`, Linux: `Ctrl+O`)
* Chose the same folder you chose when cloning your GitHub repository (if you followed the chapter [Cloning your GitHub repository in VSCode](#cloning-your-github-repository-in-vscode) it should be something like /users/YOUR_USERNAME/my_github_projects/MY_PROJECT) and then click on **Select folder**
* If successful you should now be able to see a list of files on the left

## open a file in VSCode

To open a file just click on it in the list of files in the left sidebar

If you click once on a filename you will notice that the filename on top is written in **italic**, this is because if you click only once on a filename VSCode will open it in **preview mode** meaning that if you do nothing and click on another filename, then VSCode will close the file again and instead open the new file you just clicked on, this is nice if you quickly want to lock at the content of some files and don't want to have to then close them all manually again

If you want to ensure a file stays open you need to click twice on the name, you will notice that now the filename on top is not in italic anymore, now if you click on another file the previous one will automarically get closed again

An alternative way for the file to stay open is to click on the name once and then start editing it, as soon you start editing it the name on top will go from italic to regular and the file will not get closed automatically anymore

## save a file in VSCode

The easiest way to save a file in VSCode is to use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+S` (macOS: `⌘S`, Linux: `Ctrl+S`) another way is to click on **File** in the top navigation and then **Save**

> [!MORE]  
> [VSCode "Editing basics" documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics)

## commit your changes to GitHub using the VSCode version control tool

click on the **Source Control** icon on the left in the **Activity bar** (if you have already customized VSCode, your Activity bar might be in another location) or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+G` (macOS: `⇧⌘G`, Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+G`)

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_activity_bar_source_control_icon.png)

* you will now see that all the files in which you did changes are listed in the category **Changes**
* if you double click on a filename it will open a **diff** view in VSCode that allows you to see what has changed between the current version and the previous one, the previous version of the file is on the left the current one on the right, on the right side the lines that will change are highlighted with a green color, on the left highlighted in red are the lines that will get modified, if you want to undo a change and keep the previous version you can click on the arrow in the middle of the page next to the line you want to undo
* you don't need to commit all files that have been changed all at once, if you do then just enter a commit message on top and hit the **Commit** button, else to chose which files to commit click on the + icon next to the file, this will add the file to a category called **Staged changes**, now enter a commit message for the files you selected and click on commit, this will create a commit with on those files
* next to each file you also have an icon with an arrow that points to the left, if you want to discard all of the changes you made to a file, click on that icon and it will reset the file (be careful this will delete all changes you did and you will not be able to recover them, if you are unsure create a new branch and commit the changes to that branch to have a backup just in case)

Doing a commit will create a local commit but it will not yet push that commit to the remote repository, to sync the changes with the remote repository you need to click on the icon that consits of two circular arrows next to the branch name on the bottom of the sidebar

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_sync_changes.png)

> [!TIP]  
> Synching means that the GitHub version control tool will first pull in changes from the remote repository and then right after that also do a push of your local changes to the remote repository  

## git credential manager

### VSCode asks me to chose a GitHub account every time I sync

If you have multiple users (GitHub / Gitlab accounts) or for example a GitHub account but also a personal token on your machine, then the [git credential manager](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager) will not know which one you want to use and hence it will ask you, meaning that every time you hit the sync button it will open a modal that looks like this:

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_git_credential_manager_modal.png)

> [!MORE]  
> [GitHub "git-credential-manager" repository](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager)  
> [git-credential-manager documentation](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/blob/release/docs/README.md)  

### setting a default user / token per repository

> [!TIP]  
> To avoid getting asked every time which account or token you want to use, you can set a default user for a repository

To set a default user for a repository you need to add the **USER_NAME** of the account you want to use to the remote URL of the repository

To do so open your VSCode terminal (or use your preferred command line tool) and then use the folling command:

```shell
git remote set-url origin https://USER_NAME@github.com/USER_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

then press `ENTER` and you are done

> [!MORE]  
> [git-credential-manager "Multiple users" documentation](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/blob/main/docs/multiple-users.md)

### getting a list of git credentials (on windows)

If you want to list all your git credentials that exist on your machine you can use the following command in your terminal:

```shell
cmdkey /list:git*
```

### manage git credentials (on windows)

To manage the accounts on your machine, for example if you decide to delete one of them, then you can use the [credential manager](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/accessing-credential-manager-1b5c916a-6a16-889f-8581-fc16e8165ac0) to do so, click on the windows start icon and then type **credential manager** to find it (optionally you can also open a File Explorer and enter the following path: **Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Credential Manager** to access it)

Once the **credential manager** is open select the second tab called **windows credentials**, then click on the down arrow next to the credentials you want to edit or remove, then verify those are the correct credentials and then click on either **Edit** or **Remove** depending on what you wish to do

## switching between branches

click on the **Source Control** icon on the left in the **Activity bar** (if you have already customized VSCode, your Activity bar might be in another location) or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+G` (macOS: `⇧⌘G`, Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+G`)

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_activity_bar_source_control_icon.png)

* on the bottom left you will have your current branch that you are currently on, if you did not yet create a new branch it will probably be called "main"
* click on the branch name to open the branch options on top of VSCode, here you can now chose a branch that you want to switch to (local branches have a branch icon in front of their name, branches that are on GitHub (remote branches that are in the cloud) have a cloud icon in front of their name and are called **origin**/branch_name)
  * why do I see some branch names twice? This is because a branch that for example got created by another developer will be listed as origin/BRANCH_NAME, when you check out the origin/BRANCH_NAME it will now exist both locally as **BRANCH_NAME** and also remotly (on GitHub) as **origin/BRANCH_NAME**, hence it will be twice in the list
  * a branch that only exists in the remote repository (on GitHub) or a branch you created locally but did not yet push to remote repository will only have one entry in the list

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_local_and_remote_branch.png)

## creating a new branch

on the bottom left you will have your current branch that you are currently on, if you did not yet create a new branch it will probably be called "main"

to open the branches options (on top of the IDE) click on the branch name

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_main_branch.png)

Now you have two options when it comes to creating branches, creating a new empty branch or creating a new branch based on what is in another branch (making a copy)

### create a new (empty) branch

this will open the branch options on top of VSCode and then click on **+ Create new branch** to create a new (empty) branch

![alt text](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_create_new_branch.png)

then enter a name for that new branch and you are done

### create a new branch from (based on) another branch

this will open the branch options on top of VSCode and then click on **+ Create new branch from...** to create a new branch by making a copy of an existing branch

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_create_new_branch_from.png)

* First select which branch you want to use to create the new branch
* then enter a name for that new branch

Now that the new branch is created I recommend you immediatly also publish the branch (push it to the remote repository) by clicking on the cloud icon next to its name on the bottom left of VSCode

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_publish_branch.png)

## open a VSCode terminal

VSCode has a terminal (command line tool) that by default is closed, to open the terminal click on **View** the top navigation bar and then **Terminal**

Or use the keyboard shortcut `` Ctrl+` `` (macOS: `` ⌃` ``, Linux: `` Ctrl+` ``)

The third option is to use the command palette by pressing using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+p` (macOS: `⇧⌘P`, Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and then type `view: toggle terminal`

> [!MORE]  
> [VSCode "terminal" documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics)  

## VSCode command palette

To open the VSCode command palette use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+p` (macOS: `⇧⌘P`, Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`)  

Or you use the VSCode navigation on top, click on **View** and then click on **Command Palette...**

> [!MORE]  
> [VSCode "User Interface > Command Palette" documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)  

## VSCode typescript version

To be able to switch to the **workspace typescript** version you need to first open a typescript file (if you are currently in a NON Typescript file like the README.md then the VSCode command palette will NOT show you the option), it doesn't matter which typescript file you open, just open the first one you see

Next open the VSCode command palette (if you don't remember how to do it, check out the [VSCode command palette](#vscode-command-palette) chapter above)

Then in the command palette type `TypeScript Version` and click on **TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version...**

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_typescript_version.png)

Finally select **workspace version**

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_workspace_typescript.png)

## VSCode settings

### open the settings

To access the VSCode settings there are can click on **File** in the top navigation bar, then click on **Preferences** and select **Settings**

Or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+,` (macOS: `⌘,`, Linux: `Ctrl+,`)

The third option is to use the command palette, use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+p` (macOS: `⇧⌘P`, Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`) to open the command palette and then type `preferences: open settings`

> [!MORE]  
> [VSCode "settings" documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)  

### edit settings (user / workspace)

To edit settings first [open the settings UI or file version](#open-the-settings)

You have two types of settings:

* **user** settings will apply to all your projects, these settings are saved in computers user directory, for example on windows this is something like , these settings get synchronised between all VSCode tools where you are signed in
* **workspace** settings will only apply to the project (workspace) that is currently open in VSCode, those settings get saved into a `settings.json` file that is located in a `.vscode` directory of your project (workspace), meaning that you can commit that directory with your source code to share the settings with others

On top of the settings page you have two tabs which allow you to switch between user and workspace settings

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/settings_tabs_user_workspace.png)

On the top right you have an icon to switch between the UI version of the settings and the settings file

If you are in the UI version, you will see an icon to switch to the file version:

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/settings_switch_to_file.png)

And if you are in the file version, you will see an icon to switch to the UI version:

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/settings_switch_to_ui.png)

> [VSCode "settings sync" documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync)  

## VSCode themes

The VSCode appearance can be easily customized using themes, my personal favorite is [SynthWave '84](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode)

If you haven't found your perfect theme yet, I recommend checking out [vscodethemes.com](https://vscodethemes.com/) where you can browse and preview a lot of great themes for VSCode

> [!MORE]  
> [VSCode "themes" documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes)  
> [vscodethemes.com](https://vscodethemes.com/)

### Manually adjust theme colors

You can change VSCode theme colors per user or per project in the VSCode settings, if you don't know yet how to open the settings for a user / workspace then check out the [VSCode settings](#vscode-settings) chapter

For a full list of items that can be customized check out the [VSCode theme color](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color) reference page

> [!MORE]  
> [VSCode "theme color" reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color) reference

#### Changing the VSCode scrollbar color

I personally wanted to change the color of the main scrollbar as it was barely detectable when very small, if you want to do the same here is how to do it:

Open the VSCode settings (keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+,` (macOS: `⌘,`, Linux: `Ctrl+,`)) and then type **workbench color** in the settings search field

First make sure that on the top right the **User** tab is selected and not the **Workspace** if you want to change the colors no matter what workspace (project) is open

Then under **Workbench: Color Customizations** click on **Edit in settings.json**

To customize the VSCode scrollbar colors, we have 4 options we can customize, for example like so:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    // https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color#scrollbar-control
    "scrollbar.shadow": "#4d0033",
    "scrollbarSlider.activeBackground": "#fc00a8f5",
    "scrollbarSlider.background": "#b40078",
    "scrollbarSlider.hoverBackground": "#942870"
},
```

I chose those colors as they work well with the [SynthWave '84](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode) and have a high contrast value, but of course feel free to adjust them to whatever you like best

Even though VSCode is written in Javascript and hence uses CSS for styling, the only formats that are supported by default are #RGB, #RGBA, #RRGGBB and #RRGGBBAA (where AA is the alpha value, **ff** is fully opaque and **00** fully transparent), there are however extensions that allow you to use for example gradients, I however found this [stackoverflow anser](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75739431/656689) that recommends using the [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) extension to achieve just that

> [!MORE]  
> [VSCode "Custom CSS and JS Loader" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css)

## VSCode markdown preview

Because I work a lot with markdown (and MDX) I really like the markdown preview feature in VSCode

> [!NOTE]  
> make sure you have a markdown (*.md) file open when doing this or the icon will not show up  

To preview your markdown click on the icon in the top right of the IDE that consists two panels and magnifying glass

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_markdown_preview.png)

This will put your markdown document side by side with the preview, now you can edit your markdown and it will update the preview in realtime

## VSCode (ESLint) output channel

To view the content of the **output** in VSCode you have to options:

Option 1: On the bottom right of VSCode there are curly brackets ({}), click on them and it will open a little modal:

![how to open the vscode output channel](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_output_channel.png)

Then click on **Open ESLint Output**

Option 2: Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `p` to open the VSCode command palette and then type **eslint** and choose **ESLint: Show Output Channel**

Both options will open the output channel, which will then show you all ESLint related messages

If you see that line it means the ESLint server is running in your workspace:

{/* lint ignore no-undefined-references */}
> [Info  - 8:41:03 PM] ESLint server is running.

## VSCode extensions view

To change the eslint extension settings, click on the "Extensions" icon on the right:

![VScode extensions view icon](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/vscode/vscode_extensions_view_icon.png)

Or press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `X`
