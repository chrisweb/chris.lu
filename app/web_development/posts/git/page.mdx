# git

**git** is an open source version control system, used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Git gives every developer a local copy of a project, after a developer has made his changes, he will create a new commit and then push it to a central repository, other developers can then pull that commit from the central repository into their local copy. Git makes branching (creating a separate line of development) and merging (combining changes from different branches) easy.

## Installation

### on Windows

Go to [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and click on **Click here to download** which will automatically download the latest (64bit) windows version

When the download has finished, double click on the **exe** file to start the installation

You will get asked a bunch of stuff, I usually keep the default settings but feel free to change the default values to fit your needs

### on Linux

If you are on a ditribution (like Fedora or CentOS) that come with **dnf**, then use this command:

```shell
sudo dnf install git-all
```

For distributions (like Debian or Ubuntu) that come with **apt**, then use this command:

```shell
sudo apt install git-all
```

### on macOS

If you have the Xcode command line tools already installed on your machien then you already have git

You can check if installed using this command:

```shell
git --version
```

If it is not yet installed, you can visit [git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) to see all the options, my favorite way of installing git is via brew using the following command:

```shell
brew install git
```

## check what version is installed

Use the following command in your VSCode terminal (or favorite command line tool):

```shell
git --version
```

## initialize git

To initialize a git project locally, you first need to use the following command:

```shell
git init
```

As origin I will use github but you could use any other git cloud service like gitlab for example

Next go to github and create a new repository by clicking on the "+" icon on the left of your user avatar (in the top right section of the page), then select "new repository"

Then use the following command to add the origin to your local git setup:

```shell
git remote add origin https://github.com/GITHUB_USER_NAME/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

Or you are using the git credential manager and you have multiple users, then you may want to set the default, to do so add your DEFAULT_GIT_USER_NAME into the URL like this:

```shell
git remote add origin https://DEFAULT_GIT_USER_NAME@github.com/GITHUB_USER_NAME/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

## cloning a repository

VSCode has a source control tool that makes it easy to clone repositories, but if you prefer to do it manually via the command line then use this command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GITHUB_USER_NAME/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

Or you are using the git credential manager and you have multiple users, then you may want to set the default, to do so add your DEFAULT_GIT_USER_NAME into the URL like this when cloning:

```shell
git clone https://DEFAULT_GIT_USER_NAME@github.com/GITHUB_USER_NAME/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

If you have already cloned the repository and want to add or change the default user, then use this command:

```shell
git remote set-url origin https://DEFAULT_GIT_USER_NAME@github.com/GITHUB_USER_NAME/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```
