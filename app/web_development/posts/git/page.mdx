**git** is an open source version control system, used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Git gives every developer a local copy of a project, after a developer has made his changes, he will create a new commit and then push it to a central repository, other developers can then pull that commit from the central repository into their local copy. Git makes branching (creating a separate line of development) and merging (combining changes from different branches) easy.
