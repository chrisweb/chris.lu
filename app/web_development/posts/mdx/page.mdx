# MDX

![a mad scientist mixing the content of a bottle labeled markdown with the content of another bottle labeled JSX into a big bowl labeled MDX](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/mdx/banner.png '{ banner }')

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is an extension of **markdown**, MDX means [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) + [JSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSX_(JavaScript)), [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is a markup language that can be used to format raw text, it was developed in 2004 by John Gruber in collaboration with Aaron Swartz and [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file

For an in-depth tutorial about how to use MDX with Next.js, check out my [Tutorial: Next.js static MDX blog](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-mdx-blog)

## What is MDX (behind the scenes)

MDX supports all markdown formatting elements that are also supported markdown, and even more formatting elements are available if you use plugins that add new elements like, for example, [GFM (github flavored markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) plugins

The big difference between **markdown** and **MDX**, is that **MDX** allows you to use [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) in your **markdown** content, meaning you can import and add JSX components (in our case React components) in your MDX content, for example, add a react component that is a comment section at the end of each article, or create a 3D animation using react three fiber and insert that react component in one of your articles, ...

Note: When I mention MDX on the following pages, I'm referring to MDX 3, the current version of MDX. The latest major release is MDX3 (October 24, 2023). The [MDX v3 release blog post](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v3/) contains an overview of the few breaking changes and improvements. You can check the full [MDX 3.0.0 changelog](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/releases/tag/3.0.0) on the GitHub releases page, and if you are migrating from the previous version, you may want to have a look at the [MDX v2 to v3 migration guide](https://mdxjs.com/migrating/v3/)

All transformations happen thanks to utilities built on top of [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/). It is the core project used to transform content with ASTs. The [unified github repository](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified) gives us the following description:

> Unified is an interface for parsing, inspecting, transforming, and serializing content through syntax trees

The specifications are all managed by the [syntax-tree organization on github](https://github.com/syntax-tree) which is part of the **unified** collective, this is the home for several **syntax tree** specifications, the base syntax tree is called [unist](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist), **unist** is a universal syntax tree specification, it is part of the family of syntax trees called **Abstract Syntax Trees**s hence the abbreviation **AST**s, on top of unist you have the other syntax trees that we are interested in, the first one is called [MDAST](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast) this is the specification that represents markdown in a syntax tree and the second one is called [HAST](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast) which is the specification that represents HTML in a syntax tree, but because we use MDX and not pure markdown, the two syntax trees **MDAST** and **HAST** have supersets, the superset of **MDAST** is called [MDXAST](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification#mdxast) and the superset of **HAST** is called [MDXHAST](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification#mdxhast)

**MDAST** and **HAST** are the syntax tree specifications, but the actual tools are Remark and Rehype. 

[remnark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) is a tool that transforms markdown with plugins, which they explain well in their README:

> remark supports CommonMark by default. Non-standard markdown extensions can be enabled with plugins

[rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) is similar to remark but has another purpose, Rehype is a tool that transforms HTML with plugins

MDX supports both **remark** and **rehype** plugins. More about plugins in the ["using plugins to extend MDX" chapter](#using-plugins-to-extend-mdx)

Note: if you want to experiment with MDX content, there is a great tool called [MDX playground](https://mdxjs.com/playground/). You can experiment with MDX content, and it will help you visualize how MDX content gets transformed from MDAST (markdown AST) to HAST (HTML AST) to ESAST (javascript / JSX)

## VSCode extensions

There are a lot of VSCode extensions available for both MDX and markdown, [open your extensions view](/web_development/posts/vscode#vscode-extensions-view) in VSCode and search for MDX or markdown, or visit the online [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)

In the following chapters I will introduce two extensions, one for MDX and one for markdown

### MDX extension

There is a very useful [MDX extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) that I recommend you install (if you work with MDX in VSCode)

The extension will read your .remarkrc(.js|.mjs) file (if you have one in the root of your workspace (project)) and apply the same rules you use on the command line inside of VSCode, meaning when there is a violation (based on your rules) it will underline the code that is responsible for the violation (green for warnings and red for errors)

The extension will also add MDX language support to VSCode. The support is experimental and there is a problem when setting the .mdx file association to be MDX instead of markdown, which is that VSCode will remove features like the markdown preview, I like to have the preview (even if it does NOT understand MDX and is only useful to get an idea of how the markdown parts will get rendered), the second disadvantage is that some themes have no support for MDX code highlighting colors, meaning when using some themes the MDX content will get displayed as simple text with no colors (or only a few)

To change the file association, first open an MDX file, then in the bottom right corner of VSCode you will either have "Markdown" or "MDX" set as default, if it is set to MDX then I recommend setting it to "Markdown"

Another option, if you have a `.vscode/settings.json` file in your workspace, is to edit that file and add the file association for MDX manually:

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
    "files.associations": {
        "*.mdx": "markdown"
    },
```

> [!NOTE]  
> by changing the file association to markdown, you are NOT disabling the MDX extension, it will continue to work and read your remark-link configuration file (if you have one in your workspace)

### Markdownlint extension for VSCode

[Markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) is another popular extension, that is great when you quickly want to lint pure markdown files, like your projects README.md

> [!WARN]  
> it is not recommend to install the plugin if working with MDX as it will for example use markdown linting rules like the [no-inline-html](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/v0.36.1/doc/md033.md) rule, but that rule is invalid when linting MDX (which allows using HTML elements inside of MDX content)

## Frameworks with MDX support

All major frameworks support MDX either out of the box or via packages that you can install separately, Next.js has [@next/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx), but there are alternatives that I listed in the [@next/mdx alternatives](#nextmdx-alternatives) chapter, Astro has [@astrojs/mdx](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/mdx/), Remix devs often use [mdx-bundler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdx-bundler), and Gatsby has [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-mdx), there is also a popular project called [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) which uses MDX, but it is more opinionated than the other frameworks as it focuses on building a documentation website

### Next.js MDX & markdown packages

[@next/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx) is an MDX package by the Next.js team

[next mdx remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) is an MDX package that has a feature @next/md does not, which is using remote MDX files or MDX content from a database

[markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/docs/nextjs) is a markdown only package (so no MDX), but they now have a Next.js plugin, which makes it easy to use markdoc with Next.js

[contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer) is an MDX package that was popular in the past (having earned >3k stars) but does not seem to get any updates anymore

> [!WARN]  
> This is the post suggests that its [development is currently halted](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/429). Also, as of now, the last update was almost a year ago, so be careful when considering that package
