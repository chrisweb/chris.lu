# MDX

![a mad scientist mixing the content of a bottle labeled markdown with the content of another bottle labeled JSX into a big bowl labeled MDX](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/posts/mdx/banner.png '{ banner }')

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is an extension of **markdown**, MDX means [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) + [JSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSX_(JavaScript)), [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is a markup language that can be used to format raw text, it was developed in 2004 by John Gruber in collaboration with Aaron Swartz and [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file

For an in depth tutorial about how to use MDX with Next.js, check out my [Tutorial: Next.js static MDX blog](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-mdx-blog)

## what is MDX (behind the scenes)

MDX supports all markdown formatting elements that are also supported markdown and even more formatting elements are available if you use plugins that add new elements like for example [GFM (github flavored markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) plugins

The big difference between **markdown** and **MDX**, is that **MDX** allows you to use [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) in your **markdown** content, meaning you can import and add JSX components (in our case React components) in your MDX content, for example add a react component that is a comment section at the end of each article, or create a 3D animation using react three fiber and insert that react component in one of your articles, ...

Note: when I mention MDX in the following pages, I'm referring to MDX 3 the current version of MDX, the latest major release is MDX3 (october 24 2023), the [MDX v3 release blog post](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v3/) contains an overview of the few breaking changes and improvements, you can check the full [MDX 3.0.0 changelog](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/releases/tag/3.0.0) on the github releases page and if you are migrating from the previous version you may want to have a look at the [MDX v2 to v3 migration guide](https://mdxjs.com/migrating/v3/)

All transformations happen thanks to utilities built on top of [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/), it is the core project used to transforms content with ASTs, the [unified github repository](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified) gives us the following description:

> unified is an interface for parsing, inspecting, transforming, and serializing content through syntax trees

The specifications are all managed by the [syntax-tree organisation on github](https://github.com/syntax-tree) which is part of the **unified** collective, this is the home for several **syntax tree** specifications, the base syntax tree is called [unist](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist), **unist** is a universal syntax tree specification, it is part of the family of syntax trees called **Abstract Syntax Trees**s hence the abreviation **AST**s, on top of unist you have the other syntax trees that we are interested in, the first one is called [MDAST](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast) this is the specification that represents markdown in a syntax tree and the second one is called [HAST](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast) which is the specification that represents HTML in a syntax tree, but because we use MDX and not pure markdown, the two systax trees **MDAST** and **HAST** have supersets, the superset of **MDAST** is called [MDXAST](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification#mdxast) and the superset of **HAST** is called [MDXHAST](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification#mdxhast)

**MDAST** and **HAST** are the syntax tree specifications, but the actual tools are [remnark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) which is a tool that transforms markdown with plugins and [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) which is a tool that transforms HTML with plugins

MDX supports both **remark** and **rehype** plugins, more about plugins in the ["using plugins to extend MDX" chapter](#using-plugins-to-extend-mdx)

Note: if you want to experiment with MDX content there is a great tool called [MDX playground](https://mdxjs.com/playground/), you can experiment with MDX content and it will help you visualize how MDX content gets transformed from MDAST (markdown AST) to HAST (HTML AST) to ESAST (javascript / JSX)

## Frameworks MDX support

All major frameworks support MDX either out of the box or via packages that you can install seperatly, Next.js has [@next/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx) but there are alternatives that I listed in the [@next/mdx alternatives](#nextmdx-alternatives) chapter, Astro has [@astrojs/mdx](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/mdx/), Remix devs often use [mdx-bundler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdx-bundler) and Gatsby has [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-mdx), there is also a popular project called [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) which uses MDX but it is more opinated than the other frameworks as it focuses on building a documentation website

### Next.js MDX & markdown packages

[@next/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx) MDX package by the Next.js team

[next mdx remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) an MDX package that has a feature @next/mdx has not, which is using remote MDX files or MDX content from a database

[markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/docs/nextjs) this is a markdown only package (so no MDX) but they now have a Next.js plugin which makes it easy to use markdoc with Next.js

[contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer) an MDX package that was popular in the past (having earned >3k stars) but does not seem to get any updates anymore

> [!WARN]  
> This is the post suggests that its [development is currently halted](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/429), also as of now the last update was almost a year ago, so be careful if when considering that package
