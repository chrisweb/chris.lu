# Styling and CSS libraries

Spoiler alert! I will use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) in this tutorial for the simple reason that a lot of CSS libraries had problems with **Server components** when some time ago I started to experiment with Next.js 13 and Server components. I did NOT want to add an experimental library to my project, so I started searching for an alternative

## Why CSS Modules?

When I started writing this tutorial, CSS Modules were among the few choices that worked well with Next.js 13 and Server Components, so I decided to try it. Some CSS libraries that were very popular did not work with Next.js 13, which is why the Next.js team has put up a [Next.js "CSS-in-JS" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js) page that lists those who work with client components, but it doesn't mean they work with server components (actually a lot of them still don't), for more details keep an eye on the [Emotion support for App Router Issue #2928](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/issues/2928)) or the [styled components for Next.js 13 Issue #3856](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/3856) if those are libraries you are interested in

I'm glad I chose to use CSS Modules because I rediscovered how enjoyable it can be to write vanilla CSS without having to spend time reading documentation to understand how a certain CSS library works or learning how to do something you know can be done in CSS (but you don't know how to do it with the library you are using).

On the other hand, I indeed spent a lot of time reading MDN documentation about modern CSS features, like using [custom properties (CSS variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), native [CSS nesting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting) (it is great to see this feature that you might know from pre-processors like SASS coming to CSS, but for this one I decided not to use it yet as it is maybe still a bit early in terms of [browsers that support it](https://caniuse.com/?search=css%20nesting)). I spent time learning about [calc()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc) and [color-mix()](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/css-color-mix) functions, pure CSS [on scroll animations](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/scroll-driven-animations) and a bunch more, but I feel like it was time well invested.

Feel free to skip the few chapters about styling in this tutorial if you already know CSS Modules, but if you haven't used CSS Modules and want to try out something new (even if it is only to be able to compare it to the solution you usually use), then maybe use this tutorial to get an introduction and then later decide for yourself if you want to continue using CSS Modules for your own project(s)

## Why NOT Tailwind?

I'm sorry 😢, I thought about Tailwind but in the end I decided I wanted to use CSS Modules for this tutorial. I wanted to try out CSS Modules to see if writing vanilla CSS in CSS Modules is a good alternative or not. I wanted a powerfull yet simple solution, something that feels like you are actually writing CSS and NOT using some abstraction layer I know.

If you like Tailwind and want to use it with Next.js 13 / 14, the good news is that because Tailwind introduced a new just-in-time [(JIT) compiler in version 2.1](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) and then used JIT by default starting with [version 3](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3#just-in-time-all-the-time), Tailwind will not have problems in regards to server components compared to a lot of other CSS libraries that did or still do have problems

So, if you prefer Tailwind, then using Tailwind (instead of the CSS Modules I will use here), is a good alternative

If you want to use a UI library instead, then maybe have a look at [Next UI](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui), which is a beautiful UI based on Tailwind CSS

## Getting started with CSS Modules

Next.js supports [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) out of the box, which means there is NO need to install any extra packages, and CSS Modules are **React Server Components (RSC)** compatible, which these days should be a requirement for CSS libraries that you intend to use with Next.js 13 / 14

**CSS Modules** let you write vanilla CSS in `*.module.css` files that you then import into your components or pages

Let's start with a simple example: go into the `/components/tutorial_examples` folder and create a new `UI` folder

Next, in the `UI` folder, we create a new `button.module.css` file and add the following content:

```css title="/components/tutorial_examples/UI/button.module.css"
.reset {
    background: none;
    border: none;
    padding: 0;
}
```

And then we create a second `Button.tsx` file (also in the `UI` folder) with the following content:

```tsx title="/components/tutorial_examples/UI/Button.tsx" showLineNumbers
import styles from './button.module.css'

const UIButton: React.FC = (): JSX.Element => {

    return (
        <button className={styles.reset}>
            I&apos;m a UI button
        </button>
    )
}

export default UIButton
```

Line 1: we import the CSS module

Line 6: we apply the `.reset` class we added in our `button.module.css` CSS module to the button

Then we go into the `/app/(tutorial_examples)` folder and create a new `styling` folder

Then, in the `styling` folder, we create a new `page.tsx` file and paste the following content into it:

```tsx title="/app/(tutorial_examples)/styling/page.tsx" showLineNumbers
import UIButton from '@/components/tutorial_examples/UI/Button'

export default function StylingExamplePage() {

    return (
        <>
            <UIButton />
        </>
    )

}
```

Line 1: we import our custom button component that is styled using a CSS module

Line 7: we use the button

There is not much to see yet, but if you want to check out the result, make sure your dev server is running and then in your browser navigate to the styling page at `http://localhost:3000/styling`

Great 🎉 we already know how to use CSS Modules

## CSS Modules features

What I like about CSS Modules is that they are pretty simple, which means you won't spend days reading documentation to understand how they work, yet they have some exciting and powerful features

In this chapter, we will have a look at some of them

> [!TIP]  
> For [naming](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules#naming) classes, the CSS modules team recommends using camelcase
>  
> A class name with a hyphen (kebab-case) is possible, but you will need to put the name into square brackets
>  
> For example, you have a class named `.foo-bar{:css}`, then in your component, you use it like this `className={styles['foo-bar']}{:jsx}`  

A significant advantage of CSS Modules is that you don't have to worry about unique names

The library makes them unique for you by adding a hash to the name, meaning you can have two classes named **button** in two different files, as they are **component scoped** by default, they will be unique after compilation. The disadvantage with CSS Modules is that when you look at the name using the developer tools, the class and animation names won't be precisely what you have defined, instead the format for names will be: `[filename]_[classname]__[hash]`, so they will still be recognizable but NOT exactly the same. If you don't want the CSS modules to create unique class names for you, you have the option to set a [**stable** class name](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/styling/css-modules/#enabling-user-stylesheets-with-a-stable-class-name).

Make sure your dev server is running and then in your browser navigate to the styling page at `http://localhost:3000/styling`

Then right-click, choose **Inspect** or press `F12` to open the dev tools, then open the **Elements** tab to see an example of what the class name looks like after compilation:

![chrome dev tools elements tab showing how CSS modules class names look after compilation](../../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-mdx-blog/chrome_dev_tools_inspect_css_modules.png)

If you want to add more than one class, either use a package like [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) or just use [native javascript template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) like so:

```tsx title="/components/tutorial_examples/UI/Button.tsx" showLineNumbers {6} "&#x60;${styles.reset} ${styles.core}&#x60;"
import styles from './button.module.css'

const UIButton: React.FC = (): JSX.Element => {

    return (
        <button className={`${styles.reset} ${styles.core}`}>
            I&apos;m a UI button
        </button>
    )
}

export default UIButton
```

Line 6: we use a javascript template literal to add two classes to the button (instead of just one)

Then we add the second class to our CSS Module:

```css title="/components/tutorial_examples/UI/button.module.css"
.reset {
    background: none;
    border: none;
    padding: 0;
}

.core {
    --button-padding: 6px;

    padding: var(--button-padding);
    border: 2px dashed magenta;
}
```

If you want to use the element **id** instead of a **class** to style an element, you can do it like this:

```tsx title="/components/tutorial_examples/UI/Button.tsx"  showLineNumbers{6} /styles.myIdStyle/#special
<button id={styles.myIdStyle} className={`${styles.reset} ${styles.core}`}>
```

In the CSS module file, you add the corresponding CSS like this:

```css title="/components/tutorial_examples/UI/button.module.css" showLineNumbers{14}
#myIdStyle {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
    cursor:pointer;
}


#myIdStyle:hover {
    color: black;
    background-color: white;
}
```

Here are a few more things about CSS Modules worth knowing:

* CSS modules allow you to do composition by using the compose keyword, this works like an import in javascript and allows you to include one css module into another css module
* you can change the first part of the CSS Module filename (*.module.css) to whatever you want (I usually use the same name as the component), so if my component is Button.tsx, then my CSS module will be called button.module.css
* you can use CSS modules everywhere, they are not just for components, you can use them for pages and layouts, and you can place them anywhere, here we put them into the components folder, but you can also place them in the app folder if you prefer

### Improved UI Button

The UI button we just created is an oversimplified version of a button component, in a real project, we would probably write something a little more useful like this:

```tsx title="/components/tutorial_examples/UI/Button.tsx" showLineNumbers
'use client'

import type { PropsWithChildren } from 'react'
import type { Route } from 'next'
import styles from './button.module.css'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

interface IProps extends PropsWithChildren {
    url?: string
}

const UIButton: React.FC<IProps> = (props): JSX.Element => {

    const { url, children, ...rest } = props
    const router = useRouter()

    const clickHandler = () => {
        if (url) {
            router.push(url)
        }
    }

    return (
        <button onClick={clickHandler} id={styles.myIdStyle} className={`${styles.reset} ${styles.core}`} {...rest}>
            {children}
        </button>
    )
}

export default UIButton
```

Line 1: we use the `'use client'` directive as we are going to add a click handler, if we don't explicitly mark it as a client component, Next.js will throw a runtime error like this one:

```log
Error: Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props.
<button onClick={function clickHandler} className=... id=... children=...>
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you need interactivity, consider converting part of this to a Client Component.
```

Line 3: we import the `PropsWithChildren` type from react and **line 4** we import the Route type from Next.js, so that **lines 8 to 10** we can extend the default props type by adding an entry for our `url` prop, the **url** is of type Route and is followed by a question mark which indicates we want this to be an optional prop

Line 6: we import the Next.js [useRouter](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router) hook, which will allow us to trigger a client-side navigation programmatically

Line 7: we import the Route type from Next.js 

Line 12: because React.FC is a [generic function](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html) it makes it easy for us to use our `IProps` interface, which will add type safety for the props

Line 14: we use the [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to extract the variables we will use from the props object

Line 15: we create an **app router instance**

Lines 17 to 21: we create a **click handler** using an arrow function, it will check if the url prop is defined, if it is defined, we use the app router **push** method to perform a **client-side navigation** to the provided url

Line 24: we pass our event handler function to **onClick**

Line 25: we use the **children** prop to make our button component more flexible so that whoever uses the button can define what the button text should be instead of having a hardcoded text like before, of course, this makes it more reusable

> [!NOTE]  
> Of course, you should never overengineer a component early without knowing if the added flexibility will ever be useful to anyone, for example in this case, you could have made the button a bit simpler by not checking if the URL variable has a value and just assuming the button will always get used to navigating to a page
> 
> On the other hand, it is also essential not to end up having dozens of button components in a project that are all very similar
>  
> This is why, in this case, we need it to navigate to a page, but another developer that will use the button somewhere else might not need that feature, which is why we made the feature optional
>
> Reusing components will avoid having dozens of button components in your project that, for example, look the same but do different things, this matters as more components will probably lead to higher maintenance costs and maybe even increase technical dept

Of course, now that we added a bit of reusability to our button, we also need to update the page in which we use the component to this:

```tsx title="/app/(tutorial_examples)/styling/page.tsx" showLineNumbers {9}
import UIButton from '@/components/tutorial_examples/UI/Button'

export default function StylingExamplePage() {

    const goTo = '/'

    return (
        <>
            <UIButton url={goTo}>I&apos;m a UI button, that will open the homepage</UIButton>
        </>
    )

}
```

Line 9: the UIButton **text** is now defined between the opening and closing tag (and not hardcoded in the button itself anymore, making it more reusable), and we also pass it a url prop that we have set above in the page to activate the navigation feature

## Adding a global.css

CSS Modules are perfect for styling components and even for styling the content in your pages, but at some point, you might want to add a class that can be used everywhere in your app, for example, have a global style for links, this is when you use the **global.css**

As we saw in the previous chapter, you can add classes and use the id in CSS Modules, but there is one thing you can't use in CSS Modules, and that's the [Element type selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors)

Let's (re-)open the CSS Module (that we created for our button) and add some styling for the button by using the **`button` type selector**, like so:

```css title="/components/tutorial_examples/UI/button.module.css" {14-16}
.reset {
    background: none;
    border: none;
    padding: 0;
}

.core {
    --button-padding: 6px;

    padding: var(--button-padding);
    border: 1px dashed orange;
}

button {
    color: blue;
}
```

Then make sure your dev server is running (using the `npm run dev` command), and you will see that you get an error in your terminal:

> Syntax error: Selector "button" is not pure (pure selectors must contain at least one local class or id)

So instead, if you want to style all Elements that match a certain type, or if you want to add universal selectors (`*`), or set global css variables using the [:root](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) pseudo class, then you do it in the `global.css`, which we will create in the `/app` folder, with the following content:

```css title="/app/global.css" showLineNumbers
:root {
    /* colors */
    --background-dark-value: 288 23% 20%;
    --background-dark-color: hsl(var(--background-dark-value));
    --text-dark-value: 19 71% 97%;
    --text-dark-color: hsl(var(--text-dark-value));
    --primary-dark-value: 315 60% 82%;
    --primary-dark-color: hsl(var(--primary-dark-value));
    --secondary-dark-value: 211 63% 83%;
    --secondary-dark-color: hsl(var(--secondary-dark-value));
    /* sizes */
    --spacing: 16px;
    --maxWidth: 1120px;
}

*,
*::after,
*::before {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

}

```

This is our base `global.css` which now contains a basic [CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) used to style and layout our app:

Lines 1 to 14: we set some variables (inside of the [:root](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) pseudo class) that can be used everywhere (even in any of our CSS Modules), it is recommended to use CSS variables whenever possible as in the future it will be faster to change the value of a variable in the global css instead of having to go into every file where that variable gets used and change the value there

Line 16 to 20 we use a technique seen in a lot of **reset stylesheets**, we use an asterisk (`*`) to target all elements of our HTML document and then also include their [::before](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before) and [::after](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after) pseudo elements, we set their [box-sizing CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing) to **border-box**; this will impact how the browser calculates the width and height of elements, by default **box-sizing** is set to **content-box**, in which case the width and height only include the content but NOT the border (width), padding or margin; we change **box-sizing** to **border-box**, so now the width and height will also include the border and padding but still not the margin; this way of calculating the width and height seems more intuitive then the default behavior to a lot of developers, which is why this is something you will often see in stylesheets (if however you prefer the default behavior, then feel free to not include this part in your own global.css stylesheet)

> [!TIP]  
> In CSS3, pseudo elements like **before** and **after** have two colons, so `::before{:css}` and `::after{:css}` (in CSS2, they only had one colon), check out the [MDN ::before page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before) for further details

Lines 22 to 31: we use the **html** [type selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors) and do several things:

* first, set the [font-smoothing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-smooth) CSS property to tell the browser to apply **anti-aliasing** to our fonts, if you have a dark background and light text (which we do in this example) then **anti-aliasing** can prevent the text from looking overly bold and instead makes it look lighter, but be aware that on the [caniuse CSS font-smooth](https://caniuse.com/font-smooth) page they say that this property is not part of the CSS standard, however, both webkit and firefox implement their own nonstandard property; as explained in the article ["stop-fixing-font-smoothing"](https://usabilitypost.com/2012/11/05/stop-fixing-font-smoothing/) this feature should only get used for light fonts on dark backgrounds but not for dark text on a light background, I recommend reading that article if you want to learn more about font smoothing
* then we also set the [text-size-adjust](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-size-adjust) CSS property, this feature makes sure that on mobile browsers, the text size is exactly the one we set and not inflated by the browser, this helps to avoid weird placement bugs where modified text size moves other elements around; however, if you use this feature make sure that your text is easy to read on mobile devices and tablets, if the text is too small I recommend using a bigger font-size and always keep the **text-size-adjust** set to 100%, text-size-adjust is however only supported on chrome (as of now); you can check out what browser support it on [caniuse "text-size-adjust"](https://caniuse.com/text-size-adjust)
* we also use the [tab-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/tab-size) CSS property, which is useful if, for example, you have code blocks in your content, as code blocks often contain tabs for code indentation, which means this feature is similar to setting the indent size in your [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file, if you use just a number without a unit (like in this example) then tab size will be that number multiplied by the **width** of one space (this is MOT the font-size, which is the height of your characters); so setting it to **4** and assuming a space character is 9px wide then this gives us a tab size width of `4 x 9 = 36px`
* then we set the color for our background and the default color for our text using the CSS [var()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var) function and as value we use the colors we previously defined in the `:root` pseudo element
* finally, we set the font-size to 100%, which is good for accessibility as it lets the user change the font-size via the browser settings; as we will also use the [CSS rem unit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units) for all font related sizes, this means that setting the font-size of the HTML element will have an impact on all other font-sizes in our CSS; for example, we use the CSS rem unit for the font-size of all our headings, if the user now changes the default font-size via the browser settings then all our text will adapt to that change but also all the headings will get adjusted based on the new default font-size; however, if you would have set a static value like 16px as font-size to your `<html>` element (or the `<body>` element) then the user would NOT be able to change the font-size via the browser settings, as their settings would have no effect, the font would still be 16px

Lines 33 to 36: we use the **body type selector** and reset the margin value(s) that a browser might set by default, to zero

Lines 38 to 45: we add some margin to the **footer** and **header** using the respective type selectors, we also add a minimum height to the footer, which will create a bit of space at the end of our pages, this is useful as on mobile and tablet you sometimes have a device or browser UI that will put something on the bottom of the screen that would be over your last bit of content, making the bottom part hard to read or even prevent interacting with something in your page. By adding a bit of space you ensure that the user will always see all of your content (when the page is fully scrolled down)
 
Lines 47 to 53: we use the **main type selector** to tell the browser that we want to use the [CSS Flexbox layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) by setting the **display** property to [flex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display#flex); for this element we set a maximum width using the CSS variable we created in the `:root`, the maximum width is 1120px to ensure that even on very large viewports (screens) the main element will not stretch to the full available width, this is important for the text we will place inside of our main section because if chapters of the text are very wide, it makes them hard to read; we set both the margin-left and margin-left to auto to make sure that our `<main>` element will get centered if the viewport is wider than the **max-width** we just set; finally, we also add a little bit of margin to the bottom to make sure there is a bit of space between our content and the footer of the page

> [!NOTE]  
> When choosing to use the **CSS Flexbox layout** as we did for the main element, the browser automatically assumes that the [flex-flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-flow) is set to row, which means that if we put an `<article>` into our `<main>` as well as an `<aside>` then both will get displayed as two columns next to each other (yes flex-flow row creates "columns")
>  
> When using flex-flow **row** all elements get put in a row and then expand towards the bottom, with flexbox flex-flow **column** they all elements are in a column and expand towards the right

Lines 55 to 62: here we change the **flex-flow** of the `<main>` element to **column**, which means that this time if we put an `<article>` into our `<main>` as well as an `<aside>` then both will get displayed as two rows, we do this because on devices with a viewport smaller than the maximum width of 768px, which we are targetting with our `@media all and (max-width: 768px){:css}` [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries), we want the `<aside>` element to get placed below the `<article>`

Lines 64 to 68: we add padding to sections and articles on each side using our `--spacing` CSS variable (16 pixels); as we also added maximum width to the main element, this means that the article content (if we don't have an `<aside>` element) will be a maximum 1120 - (2*16) = 1088 pixels wide; this will matter in a future chapter when we start adding images to our content; finally we set the width to 100% to make sure that the `<article>` element always uses the full width of the parent `<main>` element

Lines 70 to 72: we use the [margin-block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-block) CSS property (which is a shorthand for [margin-block-start](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-block-start) and [margin-block-end](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-block-end)) and define the size using **em** units, which will result in a margin on the top and bottom of every paragraph; the size of the margin will be relative to the font-size used by the paragraph as the unit we use is **em** (1em when used for the margin is 1 time the elements font-size); be aware that [caniuse states that margin-block](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_margin-block) is supported by all modern browsers but NOT supported by IE11

> [!NOTE]  
> Both **rem** and **em** are so called relaitve units, for example rem is relative to the font-size you have defined in the root element, which is why rem actually means **root em**, the root element of a HTML document is the `<html>` element (not the `<body>` element)
>  
> an em is a bit more complex to understand, but there is a very good explanation in the [MDN "CSS values and units" documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#lengths) so I will quote them:
>  
> > The em unit means "my parent element's font-size" if used for font-size (and "my own font-size" when used for anything else)  
>  
> So in our case above, the em we use for the margin will be relative to the font-size of the element itself, so in our case the paragraph `<p>`, the paragraph has no font-size defined so it will use the default font-size set by the browser

Lines 74 to 80: we add some color to all our links using the CSS `var()` function to use the variables we set earlier in the root, and we also use the [:hover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover) pseudo class to change the color of links on hover

Lines 82 to 110: we use the font-size and line-height properties to set a custom height for our headings (like any other values in this CSS stylesheet, those are just my examples, feel free to tweak those values to your liking)

Lines 112 to 122: we set the margin for the headings, same as for the paragraph(s) we use the [margin-block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-block) CSS property and **em** units, meaning the margins will be relative to the headings font-size (the bigger the font-size of the heading the bigger the margin will be)

## Adding the global.css to the layout
 
Now, to apply the global styles to our content, we are going to import the `global.css` inside of our **root layout** (located in the `/app` folder) like so:

```tsx title="/app/layout.tsx" showLineNumbers {1}
import './global.css'
import { Metadata } from 'next'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: 'Next.js',
    description: 'Generated by Next.js',
}

export default function RootLayout({
    children,
}: {
    children: React.ReactNode
}) {
    return (
        <html lang="en">
            <body>
                <header>
                    <p>My Header</p>
                </header>
                <main>{children}</main>
                <footer>
                    <p>My Footer</p>
                </footer>
            </body>
        </html>
    )
}
```

Line 1: we import our `global.css` stylesheet, and that's already it

Line 2: we re-add the Metadata type import, that got stripped from the layout when Next.js created a new one (as we had deleted ours), but it forget to add the type that create next app would add

Line 17 to 23: we add some new semantic elements, like a `<header>`, a `<main>` and a `<footer>` element, now that we added some CSS for them in our `global.css` file

Now (make sure your dev server is running) visit the previous example page we did in your browser `http://localhost:3000/styling`, you will already see how the background color of our page has changed and see that we now have new elements like the header and footer of our layout, that get rendered on top and bottom of our main element

Congratulations 🎉 you now know how to use CSS modules and global.css to add styling to your project
