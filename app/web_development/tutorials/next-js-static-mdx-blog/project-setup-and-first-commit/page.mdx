# Project setup and first commit

If you closed VSCode since last time, launch VSCode and open the folder we created in **Prerequisites** chapter (if you need help to open a folder in VSCode, check out my chapter [open a folder in VSCODE](/web_development/posts/vscode#open-a-folder-in-vscode) from the VSCode post)

## "preview" git branch

There are a lot of different approaches when it comes to managing code using branches, like [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), [GitLab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/), [Trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development) and many more. There is no right or wrong here, the best workflow is the one that works best for you (or for your team), this is why I recommend checking out the above links and familiarize yourself with the different workflows, then try the one out that you think is best suited and if it does not fit perfectly you can still adjust and make it your git flow 😉

Because this project is about a personal blog, I don't think we need a very complex Git Flow, this is why I will only create a second branch to commit the code updates into and then be able to preview the result (staging or testing environment), then if I'm satisfied with the result I will make a pull request (PR) to merge the code into the main branch, the main branch will then get deployed in production. If you work with others on your blog project, to avoid having to deal with merge conflicts on a regular basis, you might want to create a branch per feature (hence called feature branches) and use that branch for development, but if you are the only dev a **main** branch as well as an extra **preview** branch is probably enough.

Open VSCode and then create a new branch **from the main branch** and call it **preview** (to learn how to create a new branch from another branch (and then publish it), I recommend you check the chapter ["Creating a new branch" from the VSCode post](/web_development/posts/vscode#create-a-new-branch-from-based-on-another-branch) in my VSCode post)

> [!TIP]  
> we call our branch **preview** because later in this tutorial we will add a CI/CD pripeline via vercel.com and will use the **preview** branch to do preview deployments, the main (default) branch will be used to make production deployments

Now that the branch is created, you will see in the bottom of VSCode that our new branch is already the one selected, it is not published yet, so go ahead and publish it (yes you could consider not publishing it until you are sure that you will use the code, but I prefer to always immediatly publish them, so that if something happens to my computer I still have a copy in the cloud, of course once published it is a bit more work if you want to delete it as you need to do so locally as well as remotly but I still prefer that to losing several hours or even days worth of work)

## Create Next App (CNA)

To create a new Next.js project we are going to use [Create Next App](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-next-app) (CNA), CNA is a CLI tool created by the Next.js to get started quickly

> [!NOTE]  
> we will create the new project in the root of our directory (not a sub-directory), so make sure there is no README.md file in the directory yet, as the create-next-app tool we will use will create one and if it finds a README.md it will abort, if there is a README.md file, first delete it and then commit the changes (if you need help to commit changes using VSCode, check out my chapter [commit your changes to GitHub using the VSCode version control tool](/web_development/posts/vscode#commit-your-changes-to-github-using-the-vscode-version-control-tool) from the VSCode post)

> [!TIP]  
> I will use the option `--use-npm`, if you prefer using another package manager you can change the option to `--use-pnpm` for [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), `--use-yarn` for [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or `--use-bun` for [bun](https://bun.sh/package-manager)

Make sure the VSCode terminal is open (if you need help to open the terminal in VSCode, check out my chapter [open a VSCode terminal](/web_development/posts/vscode#open-a-vscode-terminal) from the VSCode post) and then enter the following command and then press `ENTER`:

```shell title="terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest ./ --use-npm
```

**Create Next App** will tell you it needs to be installed first, accept by typing `y` and then press `ENTER`

Next you will get asked some more questions so that Next.js knows what it needs to install and set up for you:

* **Would you like to use TypeScript?**, I recommended leaving it to **Yes** which is what is preselected, if however you prefer to use javascript select **No** using the left / right arrow keys and then just press `ENTER` (I recommend to use Typescript but I will not argue in favor or against it here, this is not the right place, if you never used Typescript before, then maybe just give it a try and see for yourself how different it is from using Javascript and after having built this blog prototype you will be able to judge for yourself which one you like more)
* **Would you like to use ESLint?**, again **Yes** is preselected, so just press `ENTER` ([ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is very useful tool that helps find and correct errors in your code)
* **Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?**, I will set this to **No**,  press `←` (the left arrow key) and then `ENTER`, I will use another styling solution in this project, more on that later) so if you want to explore another solution with me through this project then select "No" too, if you know Tailwind CSS and want to use it instead feel free to keep it on "Yes"
* **Would you like to use `src/` directory?** I will leave this on **No** and then press `ENTER`, if prefer to place all your code in an `src/` directory then press the `→` right arrow key to select "Yes", some people prefer it for example to be able to restrict searches in files to files that are in the `src/` directory and hence avoid getting result from the node_modules folder, my personal preference is to not use it as it is not required, I like to have all my directories in the root and if needed I can exclude the node_modules directory which is the same amount of work as including src instead
* **Would you like to use App Router?** definatly keep this on **Yes** and then press `ENTER`, since Next.js 13 you have two directories to chose from, you can add your pages into the **pages** directory which is the older version or you use the more modern version, which is the **app** directory, I recommend enabling the app directory (you can still later create the pages directory manually if you want to use it, both can be used alongside each other
* **Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)?** press `→` (the right arrow key) to select **Yes** and then press `ENTER`, this will tell CNA to add an alias for a given path in the `tsconfig.json` (the Typescript configuration file) if you selected **TypeScript** in the first question and if you chose **Javascript** it will create the alias in the `jsconfig.json` file (This alias can be used for imports as a replacement for a path to a dependency, to learn more about this feature I recommend you have a quick look at the [Next.js "Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases)), if however you don't want it feel free to leave it on "No"
* **What import alias would you like configured?** I personally keep the default `@/*`, but feel free to chose another one if you prefer, then press `ENTER`

That's it the **Create Next App** will now install Next.js and React (and React DOM) for us, it will then also install some development dependencies based on what we chose, like Typescript and ESLint and then it will create some default configuration files for those tools

> [!TIP]  
> when you use CNA, some of the options you chose will get stored, so that next time you use it again it will take your stored preferences instead of default values, if you want to reset those stored preferences you can use the `--reset-preferences` option like so `npx create-next-app --reset-preferences`, if successful CNA will print the following message "**Preferences reset successfully**"

## First commit

Now that create next app is done, it is a good time to do your first commit

If you need help to commit changes (and then synchronize them) using VSCode, check out my chapter [commit your changes to GitHub using the VSCode version control tool](/web_development/posts/vscode#commit-your-changes-to-github-using-the-vscode-version-control-tool) from the VSCode post

After you have commited the files and synchronised the changes with the remote repository, you can then go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and check out your repository or go directly to your repository if you remember the name, the URL should be in the format `https://github.com/MY_GITHUB_USER_NAME/MY_REPOSITORY_NAME`, by default the content of the **main** branch gets displayed on the repository homepage and because we commited our changes into the **preview** branch you need switch to the **preview** branch on GitHub to see your files (if you don't know how to switch branches on GitHub check out the [switch branches](/web_development/posts/github#switch-branches) chapter in my GitHub post)

If the commit and syncing was successful you will see that all the new files and directories are now listed in your GitHub repository

> [!TIP]  
> I recommend you commit often as it will make it a lot easier to revert your last commit if a situation arises where you need to, by having only the code from the step in one commit will make it easy to undo just that step, if you also included the code of several other steps in your commit but you actually want to keep those then reverting will be difficult
> 
> It will also create a nicer commit history where the commit messages are short and related to a few changes and probably impact a few files instead of having a huge commit messages attached to dozens of changes in lots of different files
> 
> Also commiting and synchronising often reduces the risk that you lose code and hence hours or days of work if something happens to your local machine and finally it reduces the risk that you end of having conflits, which you will likely get if you are not the only one working on the repository and only rarely commit your code

## README.md update

> [!NOTE]  
> for your future self and for others that might contribute on your project it is always helpful to have well documented project. This is why we will update the readme and place some documentation in it, if however you prefer to store such information somewhere else this is fine too, what really matters is to do update the documentation regulary so that it will not become a tedious task at some point and also is a helpful resource right from the start of your project

The first file we will edit is the `README.md`, I recommend you remove everything that is currently in the REAME.md (not that it is bad advice but we will just structure it differently and add some more information to it)

Then copy / paste the following content into your README:

```md
# MY_PROJECT

## npm commands (package.json scripts)

`npm run dev`: to start the development server  
`npm run build`: to make a production build  
`npm run start`: to start the server on a production server using the build we made with the previous command  
`npm run lint`: to run a linting script that will scan our code and help us find problems in our code  

```

> [!TIP]  
> I added 2 spaces after each line, for the 4 commands, this ensures that there is a line break after each of them  

This adds documentation to the README for 4 commands that are available after setting up a project with CNA

Then change **MY_PROJECT** to whatever you want to name your project

> [!TIP]  
> Did you know you can preview markdown files in VSCode? If not check out my short ["VSCode markdown preview" chapter](/web_development/posts/vscode#vscode-markdown-and-mdx-preview) in the VSCode post  

Now save the file (to save the file you can use the VSCode shortcut `Ctrl+S` (macOS: `⌘S`, Linux: `Ctrl+S`))

Finally commit the changes and then synchronize them
