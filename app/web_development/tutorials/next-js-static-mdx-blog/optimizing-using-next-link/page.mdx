# Optimizing links in MDX using next/link

When building our navigation earlier we saw why it is beneficial to use [next/link](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) (for internal links) instead of regular HTML anchors, so now we want to do the same for all the markdown links that we will insert into our MDX pages, because without using the **mdx-components** the parser would just transform the markdown links into regular HTML anchors

## React component for external and internal links

First we are going to create a custom Link component that will use **next/link**, **next/link** extends the HTML `<a>` element to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes and we are going to create a component that will use **next/link** for internal URLs and use a regular `<a>` element for external URLs, we will also add an icon to external URLs to give users a visible hint that if they click on that link they will leave the our app

In the `/components` folder add a new `base` folder

Then in the `base` folder create a new `Link.tsx` file and add the following code:

```tsx title="/components/base/Link.tsx" showLineNumbers /example.com/
import type { PropsWithChildren } from 'react'
import Link from 'next/link'
import type { Route } from 'next'

export interface IBaseLinkProps extends PropsWithChildren {
    href: Route<string> | URL
    target?: string
    rel?: string
    className?: string
}

const isExternalUrl = (url: string, domain: string): boolean => {

    const urlLowerCase = url.toLowerCase()

    const firstCharacter = urlLowerCase.charAt(0)

    if (firstCharacter === '#' || firstCharacter === '/') {
        return false
    }

    if (urlLowerCase.startsWith('http://') || urlLowerCase.startsWith('https://')) {

        const urlNoProtocol = urlLowerCase.replace('http://', '').replace('https://', '')

        const potentialDomain = urlNoProtocol.split('/')[0]

        if (potentialDomain !== domain) {
            return true
        }

    }

    return false

}

const BaseLink: React.FC<IBaseLinkProps> = (props): JSX.Element => {

    const { href, children, ...linkProps } = props

    const isExternal = isExternalUrl(href.toString(), 'example.com')

    const newLinkProps = { ...linkProps }

    if (isExternal) {
        newLinkProps.rel = 'noopener noreferrer'
        newLinkProps.target = '_blank'
    }

    return (
        <>
            {isExternal ? (
                <>
                    <a href={href.toString()} {...newLinkProps}>
                        {children}
                    </a>
                    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" className="iconSmall" viewBox="0 0 16 16">
                        <path fillRule="evenodd" d="M8.636 3.5a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H1.5A1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 4.5v10A1.5 1.5 0 0 0 1.5 16h10a1.5 1.5 0 0 0 1.5-1.5V7.864a.5.5 0 0 0-1 0V14.5a.5.5 0 0 1-.5.5h-10a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5v-10a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h6.636a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5" />
                        <path fillRule="evenodd" d="M16 .5a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5h-5a.5.5 0 0 0 0 1h3.793L6.146 9.146a.5.5 0 1 0 .708.708L15 1.707V5.5a.5.5 0 0 0 1 0z" />
                    </svg>
                </>
            ) : (
                <Link href={href} {...newLinkProps}>
                    {children}
                </Link>
            )}
        </>
    )
}

export default BaseLink
```

Line 1 we import the **PropsWithChildren** type from React which we will use to strictly type our props interface

Line 2 we import the [next/link](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) component

Line 3 we import the **Route** type from Next.js to strictly type the **href** variable in our props interface

Line 5 to 10 we create an interface for the props of the component by extending the react type **PropsWithChildren** and using the Next.js **Route** type for the **href** property, we also add the types for some optional properties that might be useful when re-using the component 

Line 12 to 36 we create a **isExternalUrl** function that gets the URL for our link as input and then checks if the URL is internal or external, if the URL is external it returns true else false, I used a quite naive approach to make the test but I didn't need more for my own URLs (if this is not complex enough for your own needs then feel free to improve that part, for example if you have more than one domain then you may want to use an array instead), for my use cases I just check if a URL starts with a slash or # hashtag which indicates it is an internal URL and I check if a URL starts with http or https in which case it is an external URL, except if the domain matches a value I pass as parameter which is the domain name the app will use in production

Line 38 we use the interface we just created to strictly type the props of our functional React component

Line 42 to 49 we use the **isExternalUrl** function to check if the URL is an external or internal URL, the first paramater is the URL of the current link and the second parameter is the domain of our project (replace example.com with the domain you intend to use in production), then for (external domains) we set the values for two attributes rel and target, for rel we use the 2 values, [noopener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/noopener) got introduced in HTML 5 to increase security and it is used to tell browsers if the link gets opened in a new window we don't want the website in that new window to be able to access our website by using the [window.opener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener) property, the second value [noreferrer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/noreferrer) increases the privacy of our visitors by telling the browser to not set a referrer header (referrer information does NOT get leaked), which means the website that gets visited will not know the exact source, finally the target attribute when set to **_blank** will instruct the browser to open the link in a new tab, which makes it easier for users to come back to our website by closing the new tab instead of having to navigate back one or more pages

Line 53 to 67 in the return statement we check if the link is external in which case we use a HTML anchor element and add the **external icon** behind it and if it is an internal link then we use next/link

The SVG icon that I used is from [icons.getbootstrap.com](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/), they are [MIT licensed](https://github.com/twbs/icons/blob/main/LICENSE), the icon I chose to use here is the [Box arrow up-right](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/box-arrow-up-right/) icon

## Using the BaseLink component for all markdown links

Next open the `mdx-components.tsx` (which is in the root of your project) again and and lets add a second mdx component to customize the anchor elements, like so:

```tsx title="mdx-components.tsx" showLineNumbers {2-3} {19-23}
import type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'
import BaseLink from '@/components/base/Link'
import type { Route } from 'next'

// This file allows you to provide custom React components
// to be used in MDX files. You can import and use any
// React component you want, including components from
// other libraries.

// This file is required to use MDX in `app` directory.
export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
    return {
        // Allows customizing built-in components, e.g. to add styling.
        ul: ({ children, ...props }) => (
            <ul className="listContainer" {...props}>
                {children}
            </ul>
        ),
        a: ({ children, href, ...props }) => (
            <BaseLink href={href as Route} {...props}>
                {children}
            </BaseLink>
        ),
        ...components,
    }
}
```

Line 2 to 3 we import our custom **BaseLink** component and the **Route** type from Next to strictly type the link href

Line 19 to 23 we specify that for each markdown link that got transformed into an HTML anchor element we want to use our BaseLink component to customize the link

## External icon styling in the global.css

Next we edit the `global.css` file in the `app` folder to add the styles for the svg icon(s), like so:

```css title="/app/global.css" showLineNumbers{126} {1-8}
.iconSmall {
    margin-left: calc(var(--spacing) / 4);
    display: inline-block;
    fill: currentcolor;
    font-size: 1em;
    height: 1em;
    vertical-align: -.125em;
}
```

Line 126 to 133 we add some CSS to style our icon:

* we add some **margin** on the **left** of the icon to add some space between the icon and the preceeding link
* we set the **display** property to **inline-block** to make sure the icon and the link are one after the other
* we set the **fill** property to tell the browser to use the **currentcolor** (which is the current color of our text) to as filler color for our SVG icon
* we set the **font-size** and element **height** to the same value that is being used for our text (default font-size is 1rem) so that the icon matches the height of the link text
* finally I manually adjusted the **vertical-align** value a little bit so that visually the icon is centered vertically

## Links examples using the MDX playground page

And finally we update our playground `page.mdx` file (that is in the `/app/tutorial_examples/mdx-components_playground` folder) with two links to showcase internal and external links, like so:

```md title="/app/tutorial_examples/mdx-components_playground/page.mdx"
<article>

* foo
* bar

[internal link that has our production domain](https://example.com)

[internal link starting with a slash](/internal)

[internal link starting with a hash](#internal)

[external link](https://google.com)

</article>

```

Now launch dev server (using the `npm run dev` command) and then open the [http://localhost:3000/tutorial_examples/mdx-components_playground](http://localhost:3000/tutorial_examples/mdx-components_playground) playground page URL in your browser to see the result

Congratulations 🎉 you just created a link component that will now get used for all markdown links, which means they will now all benefit from the next/link features like prefetching and optimized client-side navigation between routes, if you liked this post please consider making a [donation](https://buymeacoffee.com/chriswwweb) ❤️ as it will help me create more content and keep it free for everyone
