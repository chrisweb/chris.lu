# First Typescript page

Hope you are still there, because it is finally time to start coding (a bit) ðŸ™‚, but first a bit of theory about routing ðŸ˜‰ (feel free to skip the first chapter if you know it already) abd then we create our very first page

## Next.js routing / pages

If you used the Next.js **pages router** in the past but did not yet use the **app router** then here is a short introduction

With the **pages router** if you wanted to have a page at `www.example.com/foo` then you would create a file named foo.tsx inside of the `pages` folder

With the **app router** if you want a page at that same `www.example.com/foo` path, then you create a folder named `foo` inside of the `app` folder

Let's assume the path is now `www.example.com/foo/bar`, when using the **pages router** for path, `foo` would be a folder inside of `pages` but `bar` would be a file, with the **app router** every segment is a folder

The other difference is the page files, with the **pages router** the name of the file gets used for the last segment, in the **app router** every page is always named **page**(.jsx/.tsx)

The advantage of using a folder as last segment and having a convention that says that every page needs to be named page, is that with the introduction of the **app router** Next.js added a bunch of other [file conventions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#file-conventions), for example you can have a layout in every segment folder, you can have a not-found file in every folder and so on, meaning you can create different layouts for different parts of the website easily, or even create different error, loading, not-found, ... pages for different parts of your project (without having to add logic inside those files to check what the current path is and then show a different layout, UI or content based on it)

A feature you will already know if you used the **pages router** are [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), to create a dynamic route segment you wrap the folder's name in square brackets, for example with a folder structure like this `/app/articles/[slug]`, the **slug** could be anything, so the URL `www.example.com/articlers/foo` the slug would be foo and for another URL `www.example.com/articlers/bar` the slug would be bar, to retrieve the slug value you would use a page with the following code:

```tsx title="/app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx"
export default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  return <div>My article slug is: {params.slug}</div>
}
```

There are other useful features that got introduced with the new folder based routing, like [route groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) or [parallel routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) but those I will not cover them in this tutorial, but it is good to know they exist as they might become useful sooner or later as your project grows

## Our 1st typescript page

Start by opening the app directory which create-next-app has created for us during the intial setup of our project, if you have a bit of time have a look at what Next.js has put in there (it's always good to have a look at what the Next.js team recommends) but after that delete all the files in the `/app` directory as I want to go step by step through the process of creating a Next.js blog, you can also delete the content in the `/public` directory as we won't need the assets of the demo project anymore

Next create a new file in the app directory and name it `page.tsx` (or `page.jsx` if you chose to use javascript)

Then add the following content into the `page.tsx` file and finally save it

```tsx title="/app/page.tsx" showLineNumbers
export default function Home() {

    return (
        <>
            <h1>Hello World?</h1>
        </>
    )

}
```

Congratulations you just coded your first Next.js page ðŸŽ‰

## Start the dev(elopment) server

Now open the VSCode terminal if it isn't open yet (or use your favorite command line tool) and let's use one of the 4 commands create-next-app did add to the package.json scripts (and which we documented in README.md earlier) to start the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Now in the terminal, press `Ctrl` and then click on the Next.js local server URL or open your browser and put the following URL into the address bar: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), as you can see Next.js has compiled our typescript page and the development server has responded to the browser request, which is why we can see our "Hello World?" message

## The root layout is required

Go back to VSCode and look at the list of files in the sidebar and you will notice that Next.js re-added the `/app/layout.tsx` file (when we started the dev server) we just deleted earlier, because this layout file is called the **root layout** and it is **required** (and that's because Next.js is a clever framework that in many places helps you do the right thing ðŸ˜‰), also if you look at your VSCode terminal you will see that Next.js printed the following line, informing us that it created the layout file for us:

> Your page app/page.tsx did not have a root layout. We created app\layout.tsx for you.

If you open the file you will see that on top it has added a metadata object, this Next.js metadata API is what we will use in layouts and pages to modify the tags in the `<head>` element of our page(s), like the **title** and **description** (I will go more in detail in a future chapter)

```tsx title="/app/layout.tsx"
export const metadata = {
    title: 'Next.js',
    description: 'Generated by Next.js',
}
```

The second part it has added is just a basic typed React / Next.js layout setup

```tsx title="/app/layout.tsx"
export default function RootLayout({
    children,
}: {
    children: React.ReactNode
}) {
    return (
        <html lang="en">
            <body>{children}</body>
        </html>
    )
}
```

Layout (and Next.js pages) are React components, this layout is still very basic, it only contains the bare minimum HTML elements to create a page, in the props object we have the children that we put into the body

## edit the first page

As you might have noticed I added a question mark in the **Hello World?** heading text, let's replace the question mark with an exclamation mark and then save the file

> [!NOTE]  
> as soon as you save the file, you will see in the terminal that Next.js prints a message **Compiled in Xms (Y modules)**, which shows you that Next.js detected changes in your code base and did a new build for you

Now go back into your browser to check the page ([https://localhost:3000/](https://localhost:3000/)) and even though you haven't reloaded the page you will notice that your changes have been applied, this is because Next.js has a feature called fast refresh

## Next.js fast refresh / Hot Module Reload package

Let's go back to our project, make sure the dev server is running or use the `npm run dev` command to start it and then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser

In your browser **right click** somewhere in the page and then select **Inspect** (or open the **browser dev tools** by pressing the `F12` and then open the `Elments` tab), you will see that Next.js injects a bunch of Javascript code into our page and some of those javascript files are really heavy, this is because Next.js adds for example a tool called **Hot Module Reload** (HMR) (all the HMR code won't get loaded in production, Next.js only adds those files to our page when in development mode)

HMR starts watching for file changes as soon as you start the development server, if we edit and save (or add a new file) HMR will detect the change and tell Next.js to (re-)compile the files, then Next.js [fast refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/fast-refresh) will update the output in the browser for us

## Stop the dev(elopment) server

Earlier we started the development server but how do we stop it? If you have never done it before it might not be obvious how to do it, the easiest way to stop the development is to press `Ctrl+S` (macOS: `âŒ˜S`, Linux: `Ctrl+S`)

Then you will get asked of you really want to quit:

> Terminate batch job (Y/N)?

To confirm press enter either `Y` and press `ENTER` or just press `Ctrl+S` (macOS: `âŒ˜S`, Linux: `Ctrl+S`) again
