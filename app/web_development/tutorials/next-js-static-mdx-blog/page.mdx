# Tutorial: Next.js static MDX blog

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Prerequisites** chapter is for beginners, if for example you already have a GitHub account then you can skip that step or if you prefer to install another IDE then the one I suggest then feel free to do so

First we need a **GitHub account** to store your code in a GitHub repository, which will make it easy to access your code on multiple devices and will also allow you to share your code with others. Later on we use the GitHub to sign in to services likes Vercel.com to set up an automatic CI/CD pipeline that will automatically deploy our code and sign up for a Sentry.io account to add error monitoring, so that when a user encounters a bug it gets listed with a stacktrace in Sentry.io

* [create a GitHub account](/web_development/posts/github)

After creating a GitHub account we will need to **create a repository** on GitHub for our Code:

* [create a new GitHub repository](/web_development/posts/github#create-a-repository)

Next we will **install git**, which is a version control tool which will get used by VSCode and that we need to install before we install VSCode:

* [install git](/web_development/posts/git)

Next to be able to write code we will need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), my preferred IDE to write Javascript (Typescript) code is VSCode (Visual Studio Code):

* [install VSCode](/web_development/posts/vscode)

Now that we have installed the VSCode IDE we will login to GitHub in VSCode:

* [install VSCode](/web_development/posts/vscode#login-to-your-github-account)

Now that are connected to GitHub account in VSCode we can use the git version control tool and pull the GitHub repository we created earlier on GitHub.com:

* [install VSCode](/web_development/posts/vscode)
