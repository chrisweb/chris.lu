# Tutorial: Next.js static MDX blog

<VideoScroll />

I tried to make this tutorial as beginner-friendly as possible. If, however you have a question feel free to ask on the <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faComments} size="1x" color='rgb(255, 0, 170)' /> [discussion](https://github.com/chrisweb/chris.lu/discussions) page and if you find a bug please report it using the <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBug} size="1x" color='rgb(255, 0, 170)' /> [issues](https://github.com/chrisweb/chris.lu/issues)

In this tutorial, we will:

* create a fully static site using the Next.js v14.x (compatible with v13.x) app directory
* create several components using React v19.x (compatible with v18.x)
* add support for MDX content formatting via the @next/mdx package
* add a plugin to generate a table of contents for each post automatically
* add another plugin that will handle code block styling based on your favorite VSCode template
* add yet another plugin that will allow us to GitHub like alerts to our content
* add linting tools for both the code of the project and the content (markdown lint)
* add a CI/CD pipeline using Vercel.com so that every time we commit code to our GitHub repository, it gets automatically deployed (staging/production)
* add bugs monitoring and Content Security Policy (CSP) violations logging using Sentry.io
* install useful extensions for VSCode and learn how to use them

> [!NOTE]  
> I made this tutorial with total beginners in mind. However, if you are already an experienced Next.js dev, then there are some chapters you may want to skip
