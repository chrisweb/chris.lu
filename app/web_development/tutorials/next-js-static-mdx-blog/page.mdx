# Tutorial: Next.js static MDX blog

![banner image displaying a voodoo lady mixing potions in a big cauldron, it represents a dev using different packages to build a project using an IDE](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-mdx-blog/banner.png 'when two files meet in git diff')

In this tutorial we will:

* create static pages using the Next.js (v13.x/14.x) app directory
* create several components using React (v18.x)
* add support for MDX content formatting via the @next/mdx package
* add a plugin to automatically generate a table of contents for each post
* add another plugin will handle code blocks styling based on your favorite VSCode template
* add yet another plugin will allow us to GitHub like alerts to our content
* add linting tools for both the code of the project and the content of the posts
* add a CI/CD pipeline using vercel.com so that every time we commit code to our GitHub repository it gets automatically deployed

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Prerequisites** chapter is for beginners, if for example you already have a GitHub account then you can skip that step or if you prefer to install another IDE then the one I suggest then feel free to do so

First we need a **GitHub account** to store our code in a GitHub repository (if you prefer to use another serive like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), feel free to do so), which will make it easy to access your code on multiple devices and will also allow us to share your code with others. Later on we will use the GitHub to sign in to services like Vercel.com to set up an automatic CI/CD pipeline that will automatically deploy our code and sign up for a Sentry.io to add error monitoring, so that when a user encounters a bug it gets listed with a stacktrace in Sentry.io

* [create a GitHub account](/web_development/posts/github)

After creating a GitHub account need to **create a repository** on GitHub for our Code:

* [create a new GitHub repository](/web_development/posts/github#create-a-repository)

Next we need to **install git**, which is a version control tool which will get used by VSCode:

* [install git](/web_development/posts/git)

Next to be able to write code we need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), my preferred IDE to write Javascript (Typescript) code is VSCode (Visual Studio Code):

* [install VSCode](/web_development/posts/vscode)

Now we need to sign in to our GitHub account in VSCode and use the VSCode source control tool to make a local clone of our GitHub repository:

* [clone GitHub repository in VSCode](/web_development/posts/vscode#cloning-your-github-repository-in-vscode)

To be able to create a Javascript backend and run our Javascript code locally we need to install the Node.js runtime:

* [install Node.js (and npm)](/web_development/posts/node-js)

> [!NOTE]  
> the **next.js 14** "app directory features" require nodejs v18.17 or later, so if you skipped the Node.js installation document because you already have Node.js installed, then just make sure you have a version installed that is high enough, to do that you can for example use the following command: `node -v`

## The road to server components and server actions

React and Next.js have evolved a lot lately, the most notable additions are **server components** and **server actions**, on this page I try to list all the updates that happend during the last +-2 years in the React and Next.js ecosystem, so if you did not build a project with Next.js 13/14 yet I recommend you check it out, but if you are already an expert feel free to skip this chapter üòâ

* [the road to React and Next.js server components and server actions](/web_development/posts/road-to-react-next-js-server-side-features)

## Getting started

If you closed VSCode since last time, launch VSCode and open the folder we created in **Prerequisites** chapter (if you need help to open a folder in VSCode, check out my chapter [open a folder in VSCODE](/web_development/posts/vscode#open-a-folder-in-vscode) from the VSCode post)

### create a new "preview" git branch

There are a lot of different approaches when it comes to managing code using branches, like [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), [GitLab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/), [Trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development) and many more. There is no right or wrong here, the best workflow is the one that works best for you (or for your team), this is why I recommend checking out the above links and familiarize yourself with the different workflows, then try the one out that you think is best suited and if it does not fit perfectly you can still adjust and make it your git flow üòâ

Because this project is about a personal blog, I don't think we need a very complex Git Flow, this is why I will only create a second branch to commit the code updates into and then be able to preview the result (staging or testing environment), then if I'm satisfied with the result I will make a pull request (PR) to merge the code into the main branch, the main branch will then get deployed in production. If you work with others on your blog project, to avoid having to deal with merge conflicts on a regular basis, you might want to create a branch per feature (hence called feature branches) and use that branch for development, but if you are the only dev a **main** branch as well as an extra **preview** branch is probably enough.

Open VSCode and then create a new branch **from the main branch** and call it **preview** (to learn how to create a new branch from another branch (and then publish it), I recommend you check the chapter ["Creating a new branch" from the VSCode post](/web_development/posts/vscode#create-a-new-branch-from-based-on-another-branch) in my VSCode post)

> [!TIP]  
> we call our branch **preview** because later in this tutorial we will add a CI/CD pripeline via vercel.com and will use the **preview** branch to do preview deployments, the main (default) branch will be used to make production deployments

Now that the branch is created, you will see in the bottom of VSCode that our new branch is already the one selected, it is not published yet, so go ahead and publish it (yes you could consider not publishing it until you are sure that you will use the code, but I prefer to always immediatly publish them, so that if something happens to my computer I still have a copy in the cloud, of course once published it is a bit more work if you want to delete it as you need to do so locally as well as remotly but I still prefer that to losing several hours or even days worth of work)

### using Create Next App (CNA)

To create a new Next.js project we are going to use [Create Next App](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-next-app) (CNA), CNA is a CLI tool created by the Next.js to get started quickly

> [!NOTE]  
> we will create the new project in the root of our directory (not a sub-directory), so make sure there is no README.md file in the directory yet, as the create-next-app tool we will use will create one and if it finds a README.md it will abort, if there is a README.md file, first delete it and then commit the changes (if you need help to commit changes using VSCode, check out my chapter [commit your changes to GitHub using the VSCode version control tool](/web_development/posts/vscode#commit-your-changes-to-github-using-the-vscode-version-control-tool) from the VSCode post)

> [!TIP]  
> I will use the option `--use-npm`, if you prefer using another package manager you can change the option to `--use-pnpm` for [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), `--use-yarn` for [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or `--use-bun` for [bun](https://bun.sh/package-manager)

Make sure the VSCode terminal is open (if you need help to open the terminal in VSCode, check out my chapter [open a VSCode terminal](/web_development/posts/vscode#open-a-vscode-terminal) from the VSCode post) and then enter the following command and then press `ENTER`:

```shell title="terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest ./ --use-npm
```

**Create Next App** will tell you it needs to be installed first, accept by typing `y` and then press `ENTER`

Next you will get asked some more questions so that Next.js knows what it needs to install and set up for you:

* **Would you like to use TypeScript?**, I recommended leaving it to **Yes** which is what is preselected, if however you prefer to use javascript select **No** using the left / right arrow keys and then just press `ENTER` (I recommend to use Typescript but I will not argue in favor or against it here, this is not the right place, if you never used Typescript before, then maybe just give it a try and see for yourself how different it is from using Javascript and after having built this blog prototype you will be able to judge for yourself which one you like more)
* **Would you like to use ESLint?**, again **Yes** is preselected, so just press `ENTER` ([ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is very useful tool that helps find and correct errors in your code)
* **Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?**, I will set this to **No**,  press `‚Üê` (the left arrow key) and then `ENTER`, I will use another styling solution in this project, more on that later) so if you want to explore another solution with me through this project then select "No" too, if you know Tailwind CSS and want to use it instead feel free to keep it on "Yes"
* **Would you like to use `src/` directory?** I will leave this on **No** and then press `ENTER`, if prefer to place all your code in an `src/` directory then press the `‚Üí` right arrow key to select "Yes", some people prefer it for example to be able to restrict searches in files to files that are in the `src/` directory and hence avoid getting result from the node_modules folder, my personal preference is to not use it as it is not required, I like to have all my directories in the root and if needed I can exclude the node_modules directory which is the same amount of work as including src instead
* **Would you like to use App Router?** definatly keep this on **Yes** and then press `ENTER`, since Next.js 13 you have two directories to chose from, you can add your pages into the **pages** directory which is the older version or you use the more modern version, which is the **app** directory, I recommend enabling the app directory (you can still later create the pages directory manually if you want to use it, both can be used alongside each other
* **Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)?** press `‚Üí` (the right arrow key) to select **Yes** and then press `ENTER`, this will tell CNA to add an alias for a given path in the `tsconfig.json` (the Typescript configuration file) if you selected **TypeScript** in the first question and if you chose **Javascript** it will create the alias in the `jsconfig.json` file (This alias can be used for imports as a replacement for a path to a dependency, to learn more about this feature I recommend you have a quick look at the [Next.js "Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases)), if however you don't want it feel free to leave it on "No"
* **What import alias would you like configured?** I personally keep the default `@/*`, but feel free to chose another one if you prefer, then press `ENTER`

That's it the **Create Next App** will now install Next.js and React (and React DOM) for us, it will then add some development dependencies based on what we chose, like Typescript and ESLint and then it will add some default configuration files for each of these tools

> [!TIP]  
> when you use CNA, some of the options you chose will get stored, so that next time you use it again it will take your stored preferences instead of default values, if you want to reset those stored preferences you can use the `--reset-preferences` option like so `npx create-next-app --reset-preferences`, if successful CNA will print the following message "**Preferences reset successfully**"

### first commit

Now that create next app is done, it is a good time to do your first commit

If you need help to commit changes (and then synchronize them) using VSCode, check out my chapter [commit your changes to GitHub using the VSCode version control tool](/web_development/posts/vscode#commit-your-changes-to-github-using-the-vscode-version-control-tool) from the VSCode post

After you have commited the files and synchronised the changes with remote repository, you can go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and check out your repository or go directly to your repository if you remember the name, the URL should be in the format `https://github.com/MY_GITHUB_USER_NAME/MY_REPOSITORY_NAME`, by default the content of the **main** branch gets displayed and because we commited our changes into the **preview** branch you need switch to the **preview** branch on GitHub to see your files (if you don't know how to switch branches on GitHub check out the [switch branches](/web_development/posts/github#switch-branches) chapter in my GitHub post)

If the commit and syncing was successful you will see that all the new files and directories are now listed in your GitHub repository

> [!TIP]  
> I recommend you commit often as it will make it a lot easier if you decide to revert your last commit, because it will only include the code from one step you want to undo and NOT also the code of several other steps that you actually want to keep, it will also create a nicer commit history where the commit messages are short and related to a few files instead if having a huge commit messages attached to dozens of files, also commiting and synchronising often reduces the risk that you lose code and hence hours or days of work if something happens to your local machine and finally it reduces the risk that you end of having conflits if you are not the only one working on the repository

### update the README.md file

> [!NOTE]  
> for your future self and for others that might contribute on your project it is always helpful to have well documented project. This is why we will update the readme and place some documentation in it, if however you prefer to store such information somewhere else this is fine too, what really matters is to do update the documentation regulary so that it will not become a tedious task at some point and also is a helpful resource right from the start of your project

The first file we will edit is the `README.md`, I recommend you remove everything that is currently in the REAME.md (not that it is bad advice but we will just structure it differently and add some more information to it)

Then copy / paste the following content into your README:

```md
# MY_PROJECT

## npm commands (package.json scripts)

`npm run dev`: to start the development server  
`npm run build`: to make a production build  
`npm run start`: to start the server on a production server using the build we made with the previous command  
`npm run lint`: to run a linting script that will scan our code and help us find problems in our code  

```

> [!TIP]  
> I added 2 spaces after each line, for the 4 commands, this ensures that there is a line break after each of them  

This adds documentation to the README for 4 commands that are available after setting up a project with CNA

Then change **MY_PROJECT** to whatever you want to name your project

> [!TIP]  
> Did you know you can preview markdown files in VSCode? If not check out my short [mardown preview chapter](/web_development/posts/vscode#vscode-markdown-preview) in the VSCode post  

Now save the file (to save the file you can use the VSCode shortcut `Ctrl+S` (macOS: `‚åòS`, Linux: `Ctrl+S`))

Finally commit the changes and then synchronize them

### Next.js typescript plugin

Since [Next.js 13.1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-1) the Next.js team added a new Typescript plugin:

> We've built a new TypeScript plugin that provides suggestions for page and layout configuration options and provides helpful usage hints around Server and Client Components

[Delba de Oliveira](https://github.com/delbaoliveira) which is part of the next.js developer experience team posted a [a short "Next.js Typescript plugin" introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqMqn9fKEf8) on Youtube that you may want to watch

#### enabling the Next.js Typescript plugin

To make the Next.js typescript plugin work you need to change the Typescript version that VSCode is using to the **workspace version** (the version that Next.js create app just installed), because by default VSCode will use a built in Typescript version

If you don't know how yet how to change the typescript version to **workspace version** (in VSCode), check out the [VSCode typescript version](/web_development/posts/vscode#vscode-command-palette) chapter in the VSCode post

As soon as you switch to the **workspace version**, VSCode will create new `.vscode/settings.json` file (or if you already have a VSCode settings.json it will extend it), there is nothing wrong in sharing that file as it will ensure that everyone that works on your project (or if you use multiple devices yourself) that they use the same workspace settings, like the typescript workspace version but also in one of the next chapters we will add useful VSCode extension and they will be listed in settings file too, so if someone does not have the extension installed VSCode will show a modal that suggests installing it

> [!TIP]  
> Next.js typescript plugin comes with some useful features, for example you will have typed routes, meaning that if you use next/link and set a href to a page that doesn't exist you will get a warning, it will also warn you if something is wrong in how you use the **use client** directive in your components and some more, I recommend to keep an eye on the [Next.js "typescript" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript) as the Next.js team adds more features over time

finally I recommend you commit / sync the new `.vscode/settings.json`

> [!MORE]  
> [Next.js "TypeScript" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript)  

##### Statically Typed Links (Routes)

> [!WARN]  
> There seems to be a bug in the route types for `*.mdx` pages, when doing a prod build, when doing a dev build all routes are typed and listed in the `.next/types/link.d.ts` but they are missing in prod resulting in a **Type error** "XY is not an existing route.", so even though this feature seems very promissing, as of now I recommend to keep it turned off (set to false) if you have are using `*.mdx` pages (which is what we will do in this tutorial)

To ensure we benefit from **statically typed links** there is one more step needed, open the `next.config.mjs` and then add the **experimental** typedRoutes to your Next.js configuration file like so:

```js title="next.config.mjs" showLineNumbers {3-5}
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    experimental: {
        typedRoutes: true,
    },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

Line 1 you can see that the Next.js configuration file uses [jsdoc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) with the `@type` Typescript script, which allows us to have types even though the configuration file is not Typescript (but Javascript), which means if you start typing inside of the nextConfig object you will benefit from autocompletation for the Next.js configuration options

Line 3-5 we use the typedRoutes (experimental) option and enabled it, which means that when using `npm run dev` or when building for production, Next.js will generate a `.next/types/link.d.ts` file that contains information about all existing routes in our application, the advantage of this is that if we now use [next/link](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#link-component) but set the href to a route that doesn't exist we will see an error in VSCode getting displayed and builds will fail until we fix the typo in our URL

> [!NOTE]  
> You might have noticed that in the latest Next.js the configuration file is now an [ECMAScript module](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) (ES modules / ESM) and not a [CommonJS module](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules) like in previous versions, which is why the extension is now `.mjs` and not `.js` anymore, this means that instead of using a require function to import other modules we now use the same import statement we use in client code, this change also matters because more and packages on npm are migrating to an ESM only format, which reduces the amount of code needed as they can drop CommonJS backward compatibility, but for us it means we must use import statements and can't NOT use the require function anymore  

then save your `next.config.mjs` and commit / sync your latest changes

> [Next.js "typedRoutes (experimental)" reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/typedRoutes)  

###### typedRoutes bug and Next.js phases parameter

> [!WARN]  
> right now there is a bug in Next.js that prevents MDX pages (page.mdx) to be recognized as routes when doing a production build (in development the typed routes work well), I opened a [ticket #62335 on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/62335), until the bug is fixed I suggested only enabling the **typedRoutes in development**, you can do so by using the next config **phase** parameter, to check if current phase is **PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER**

```js title="next.config.mjs" showLineNumbers {1} {3} {10}#special
import { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } from 'next/constants.js'

const nextConfig = (phase) => {

    /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
    const nextConfig = {
        experimental: {
            // experimental typescript "statically typed links"
            // https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript#statically-typed-links
            typedRoutes: phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER ? true : false,
        },
    }

    return nextConfig

}

export default nextConfig;
```

Line 3 we have converted our next config object into a function, this allows us to use the Next.js configuration **phase** parameter, phase allows us to check what the current context of our Next.js app is, in our configuration we import the `PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER` constant and then line 10 we check if the phase is **development server**, if it is we enable typedRoutes and if it is NOT we disable the typedRoutes option

Next.js has some constants to make it easier to check what phase the app is in, those constants can be found in [src/shared/lib/constants](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/shared/lib/constants.ts#L38-L43)

### React (strict mode) and powered by header

[React strict mode](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode) and [powered by header(s)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/poweredByHeader) are two configuration options that often lead to controversial discussions among developers

**React strict mode** is **enabled by default** since **Next.js v13.4** for the **app router** (not the pages router), you can disable the React strict mode in the `next.config.mjs` by setting option to **false**

> [!NOTE]  
> for example if you don't want the **Strict Mode** to be enabled in your entire project, then disable it via the Next.js configuration file and then use the `<StrictMode>` only in the pages / layouts ... in which you want to enable it

I recommend not disabling the React Strict Mode, I see posts on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) where people argue to turn it off as it causes problems in their app, however in my opinion this is masking problems instead of fixing the root cause, as mentioned on react.dev the Strict Mode does several important things, one of them is **checking if your components use deprecated APIs**

> [!TIP]  
> will only run in **development** and NOT in production, this is another reason to keep it turned on, even if it would lead to a problem in development it will NOT have any impact on your production build and hence have no impact on what your users experience

What surprises developers the most when they use React Strict Mode for the first time, is that re-renders components an extra time (in development), hence every component gets rendered (and effects triggered) then the components get unmounted and then get mounted a second time, this is done to detect problems, here is the explanation from the React.dev documentation as to why this is done:

> React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs (props, state, and context). Components breaking this rule behave unpredictably and cause bugs.

So if for some reason you don't want it to be enabled in your entire app or if you need to disable it temporarely, then you can do it in the Next.js configuration file:

```js title="next.config.mjs" showLineNumbers {3}
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    reactStrictMode: false,
};

export default nextConfig;
```

**Next.js powered by header** is another Next.js configuration option, that if enabled will add an **x-powered-by** header to all of your pages

Here is an example of the headers showing the **x-powered-by** header Next.js adds to pages, I used the **chrome dev tools**, opened the **Network tab** and then clicked on the row of the page to inspect the **response headers**:

![](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-mdx-blog/network_headers_powered_by.png)

Why would you want to turn this configuration option off?

When I get asked this, my first thought is to ask myself the opposite "why would I want to turn it on?" and honestly I have not yet found a reason as to why I would want to have it turned on. Another reason why I personally prefer to turn it off is because unfortunatly some people on the web have malicious intentions and the less they know about your apps technology stack the more difficult it will be for them to find vulnerabilities that have been disclosed but are not yet patched in the version you are using. Yes it does not make a huge difference, because hackers usually just launch batteries of tests that will check for a wide range of known vulnerabilities, few will use a bot that checks for **x-powered-by** headers to specifically target the exact version you are using. Also true, hackers can use profilling tools to get approximative information about what tech stack you are using. So yes, disabling the poweredByHeader option is not a miracle solution, that will prevent all potential attacks, but if there is a chance (no matter how small) that turning it off will make my app just a little bit safer then that's good enough for me and as I said earlier the second reason is that I see no reason why I would want to turn it on.

```js title="next.config.mjs" showLineNumbers {3}
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    poweredByHeader: false,
};

export default nextConfig;
```

If you did any of the two changes I mentioned above , then save your `next.config.mjs` and commit / sync your latest changes

## first page

### Our first typescript (javascript) page

Hope you are still there, because it is finally time to start coding (a bit) üôÇ

But first lets open the app directory create next app has created for us, if you have a bit of time have a look at what they put in there (it's always good to have a look at what the Next.js team recommends) but after that delete all the files in the `/app` directory as I want to go step by step through the process of creating a Next.js blog, you can also delete the content in the `/public` directory as we won't need the assets of the demo project anymore

Next create a new file in the app directory and name it `page.tsx` (or `page.jsx` if you chose to use javascript)

Then add the following content into the `page.tsx` file and finally save it

```tsx title="/app/page.tsx" showLineNumbers
export default function Home() {

    return (
        <>
            <h1>Hello World?</h1>
        </>
    )

}

```

Congratulations you just coded your first Next.js page

### start the dev(elopment) server

Now open the VSCode terminal if it isn't open yet (or use your favorite command line tool) and let's use one of the 4 commands we added to our README.md earlier to start the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Now in the terminal, press `Ctrl` and then click on the Next.js local server URL or open your browser and put the following URL into the address bar: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

> [!NOTE]  
> port 3000 is the default, the port will be something else if:  
>
> * it was already in use Next.js will have taken another port  
> * you have used the **-p** option for next.js **dev** or **start** cli commands, for example in your package.json use the option like so `next dev -p 4000` to change the port to 4000
>
> if you want to know for sure what port is being used check the terminal, Next.js will have printed the URL of the dev server

If you inspect the source of the page, you will see that Next.js injects a bunch of Javascript code into our page and some of those javascript files are really heavy, this is because Next.js adds for example a tool called **Hot Module Reload** (HMR), which will run in the background and update the project for us every time we edit and then save a file in our project, Next.js calls this [fast refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/fast-refresh), then it will reload the content in the browser for us, all of that code however won't make it into production, Next.js only adds those tool when in development mode (we are in development mode because we use the dev server command)

Now go back to VSCode and look at the list of files in the sidebar and you will notice that Next.js re-added the `/app/layout.tsx` file we just deleted earlier, that's because Next.js is a nice framework and it will always have your back, well and also because this layout file is called the **root layout** and it is **required**, also if you look at your VSCode terminal you will see that Next.js printed the following line, informing us that it created the layout file for us:

> Your page app/page.tsx did not have a root layout. We created app\layout.tsx for you.

If you open the file you will see that on top it has added a metadata object, this Next.js metadata API is what we will use in layouts and pages to modify the tags in the `<head>` element of our page(s), like the **title** and **description** (I will go more in detail in a future chapter)

The second part it has added is just a basic React setup

```tsx title="/app/layout.tsx" {1-4} showLineNumbers
export const metadata = {
    title: 'Next.js',
    description: 'Generated by Next.js',
}

export default function RootLayout({
    children,
}: {
    children: React.ReactNode
}) {
    return (
        <html lang="en">
            <body>{children}</body>
        </html>
    )
}

```

### edit the first page

As you might have noticed I added a question mark in the **Hello World?** heading text, let's replace the question mark with an exclamation mark and then save the file

> [!NOTE]  
> as soon as you save the file, you will see in the terminal that Next.js prints a message **Compiled in Xms (Y modules)**, which shows you that Next.js detected changes in your code base and did a new build for you

Now go back into your browser and even though you haven't reloaded the page you will notice that your changes have been applied

Time to make another commit (and sync the changes) and then call it a day üòâ

## CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployments

In this chapter we will set up a CI/CD pipeline, that will automatically deploy our code using [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)

> [!NOTE]  
> You might still remember how in the past we would use a FTP software and manually transfer code to a server, or you might have struggled setting up GitHub actions... When using Vercel they will set up the workflow for us and then they will start monitoring our repository and when they detect a new commit (or pull request) they will fetch our code and automatically deploy it (on their infrastructure) for us
>
> This means we don't have to do anything else besides commiting our code as we have already done before but there will be no new additional step, you don't even need to click a button üòâ

Of course if you prefer to use GitHub actions to create your own CI/CD pipeline feel free to do so, also feel free to use another provider but in this example I show you how easy and quick it is using [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com), the Hobby plan is free so if you don't know vercel yet you might want to give it a try to get an idea of how it performs compared your current deployment process

### vercel setup

First you need to have or create a hobby (free) account on [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) (if you need help with that step, check out my chapter [Create a Vercel account (sign up)](/web_development/posts/vercel#create-an-account-sign-up) in the Vercel post)

Now we need create a new project on Vercel and allow them to access our repository (if you need help with that step, check out my chapter [Add a new project (repository)](/web_development/posts/vercel#add-a-new-project-repository) in the Vercel post)

Now that we have added our GitHub repository to vercel, every commit (or pull request) we do into the **main** branch will trigger a **production** deployment and every commit we do into the **preview** branch will trigger a **preview** (staging) deployment

### testing preview deployments

To see how this works open a new tab in your browser and open the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) page, in the **Projects** list click on the name of your project to access the project page (something like `https://vercel.com/MY_USER_NAME-projects/MY_PROJECT_NAME`), on top you will have section called **Production Deployment** and below that a section called **Active Branches** which is still empty (No Preview Deployments)

Now open VSCode and make sure you are on the **preview** branch

Open the `README.md` file and for example add a small explanation that our project is now auto deploying on vercel, like so:

```md
# MY_PROJECT

## npm commands (package.json scripts)

`npm run dev`: to start the development server  
`npm run build`: to make a production build  
`npm run start`: to start the server on a production server using the build we made with the previous command  
`npm run lint`: to run a linting script that will scan our code and help us find problems in our code  

## CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployments

Everytime code gets pushed into the main branch it will trigger a production deployment, when code gets pushed into the preview branch it will trigger a preview deployment

```

Then save the file, commit and sync the changes and immediatly open the browser tab in which you opened your vercel project page, in the section **Active Branches** you should now see an entry for the **preview** branch (if it does not show up, manually reload the page), if you click on **View Deployment Status** it will open a page with details about the current deployment

Back on the project page, click on the **3 dots** (...) at the end of your preview branch row and then click on **Copy Branch URL**

Your branch URL will be something like `MY_PROJECT_NAME-git-preview-MY_USER_NAME.vercel.app`, paste the branch URL you just copied into your browsers address bar and press `Enter`

> [!NOTE]  
> when you visit your preview URL vercel will ask you to log in (if you are not logged in yet), this is because only you are supposed to have access to the previews, if someone else wants access they will first have to request access and wait for you to grant them access

Congratulations, you are now viewing a preview version of your project hosted on vercel

Because GitHub and Vercel are now connected, you will also have all the information about your deployments on your GitHub page, open the repository page on GitHub and have a look at the right sidebar you will now see a new section called **Deployments**:

If for example you click on **preview** it will open the deployments page, on top you will have a link to the live preview on vercel.app and below you will have a list of the recent deployments

## Error handling and logging

As we saw earlier each route segment is directory and each directory contains a page file, but unlike the page router, when using the app router we can add more than just pages, one of those files is an error file

How this works is that Next.js will automatically wrap the children of your page with a **React Error Boundary**, meaning that when an error gets thrown in a page then the error boundary will contain it and then use the error file that is the closest (either an error file that is in the same directory as the page itself or a parent directory) as a fallback

Let's create our first error file inside of our app directory and let's use the example from the Next.js documentation, like so:

```ts title="app/error.tsx" showLineNumbers {13-16}
'use client' // Error components must be Client Components

import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function Error({
    error,
    reset,
}: {
    error: Error & { digest?: string }
    reset: () => void
}) {

    useEffect(() => {
        // Log the error to an error reporting service
        console.error(error)
    }, [error])

    return (
        <div>
            <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
            <button
                onClick={
                    // Attempt to recover by trying to re-render the segment
                    () => reset()
                }
            >
                Try again
            </button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

As you can see the Next.js documentation example uses a `useEffect(){:.fn}` function to log the error in our console, but what happens if the error is getting triggered on a users computer, then we won't know about, so as Next.js suggests, in the second part of this chapter, we will use a third party service called [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to do the logging for us (of course if you prefer you can also develop and run your own logging service instead)

> [!MORE]  
> [Next.js "Handling Errors" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling)  

### Sentry.io SDK for Next.js setup

In this chapter we will use [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) (which has a free plan for side projects) to add error logging to the Next.js error file we just created

First you need to have or create an account on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) (if you need help with that step, check out my chapter [Create a Sentry account (sign up)](/web_development/posts/sentry-io#create-an-account-sign-up) in the Sentry.io post)

Now we need create a new project on Sentry.io (if you need help with that step, check out my chapter [Create a Sentry.io project](/web_development/posts/sentry-io#create-a-sentryio-project) in the Sentry.io post)

Now that the project is created we will use the Sentry.io Wizard tool to install the Sentry.io SDK for Next.js (if you need help with that step, check out my chapter [Sentry.io SDK for Next.js projects](/web_development/posts/sentry-io#sentryio-sdk-for-nextjs-projects) in the Sentry.io post)

After creating a Sentry.io project and setting up the SDK I recommend also using the [Sentry.io integration on Vercel](https://vercel.com/integrations/sentry) as this will automate the part **"Adding the Sentry authentication token as an environment variable to your CI setup"** that we just saw when using the Sentry.io wizard (if you need help with that step, check out my chapter [Sentry integration for Vercel](/web_development/posts/vercel#sentry-integration-for-vercel) in the Vercel post)

Finally now that you have installed the SDK you might want to some fine tuning of the Sentry.io configuration (if you need help with that step, check out my chapter [Sentry.io for Next.js configuration](/web_development/posts/sentry-io#sentryio-for-nextjs-configuration) in the Sentry.io post)

### Error logging using Sentry.io

Now that Sentry.io is set up we can modify the error file we created earlier and add import the Sentry SDK and add the Sentry.io logging function inside of the `useEffect(){:.fn}` to replace the example console.log, like so:

```ts title="app/error.tsx" showLineNumbers {3} {14-17}
'use client' // Error components must be Client Components

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function Error({
    error,
    reset,
}: {
    error: Error & { digest?: string }
    reset: () => void
}) {

    useEffect(() => {
        // Log the error to Sentry.io
        Sentry.captureException(error)
    }, [error])
```

> [!MORE]  
> [Sentry.io "Next.js SDK" documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/)  

### Handling global errors

The Sentry.io wizard we just used has created a Next.js `app/global-error.jsx` file for us, the Next.js documentation explains well why this file is important:

> The root app/error.js boundary does not catch errors thrown in the root app/layout.js or app/template.js component.
>
> To specifically handle errors in these root components, use a variation of error.js called app/global-error.js located in the root app directory.
>
> global-error.js is the least granular error UI and can be considered "catch-all" error handling for the whole application.

But because Sentry created a **javascript** file but our project uses **typescript**, we will start by converting the file into a typescript file, by renaming `app/global-error.jsx` to `app/global-error.tsx`

After renaming the file we edit it and replace its content with the code for a global error page from the Next.js documentation, which is a good start as it is strictly typed, the only difference is that we also modify the code to add the Sentry.io `captureException(){:.fn}` function, that will capture exceptions and send them to Sentry.io, the final version looks like this:

```ts title="app/global-error.tsx" showLineNumbers
'use client'

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function GlobalError({
    error,
    reset,
}: {
    error: Error & { digest?: string }
    reset: () => void
}) {

    useEffect(() => {
        Sentry.captureException(error)
    }, [error])

    return (
        <html>
            <body>
                <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
                <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>
            </body>
        </html>
    )
}
```

Now we have error handling and logging, for pages as well as a global error handling file that will handle root layout error and act as a catch all for app errors, time to save, commit and sync

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

Using [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) headers is not required to make an app work but it is highly recommended as it will make your project more secure

> [!TIP]  
> I like to set up the CSP headers as early as possible, because if you wait until the last moment before going into production and then decide to add them, then you will probably have a bunch of **violations** that get reported and it might take some time to adjust your CSP rules, this why I recommend starting as early as possible and fix the violations one by one as soon as they occur

### Adding CSP Headers in Next.js configuration

To add CSP rules to our Next.js project we need to edit the `next.config.mjs` in the root of our project

Add the following lines to your configuration:

```js title="next.config.mjs"
// CSP headers here is set based on Next.js recommendations:
// https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy
const cspReportOnly = true;

const cspHeader = () => {

    const upgradeInsecure = cspReportOnly ? '' : 'upgrade-insecure-requests;'

    // worker-src is for sentry replay
    // child-src is because safari <= 15.4 does not support worker-src
    const defaultCSPDirectives = `
        default-src 'none';
        media-src 'self';
        object-src 'none';
        worker-src 'self' blob:;
        child-src 'self' blob:;
        manifest-src 'self';
        base-uri 'none';
        form-action 'none';
        require-trusted-types-for 'script';
        frame-ancestors 'none';
        ${upgradeInsecure}
    `

    // when environment is preview enable unsafe-inline scripts for vercel preview feedback/comments feature
    // and whitelist vercel's domains based on:
    // https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/specialized-usage#using-a-content-security-policy
    // and white-list vitals.vercel-insights
    // based on: https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#content-security-policy
    if (process.env.VERCEL_ENV === 'preview') {
        return `
            ${defaultCSPDirectives}
            font-src 'self' https://vercel.live/;
            style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://vercel.live/fonts;
            script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://vercel.live/;
            connect-src 'self' https://vercel.live/ https://vitals.vercel-insights.com https://*.pusher.com/ wss://*.pusher.com/ ${reportingDomainWildcard};
            img-src 'self' data: https://vercel.com/ https://vercel.live/;
            frame-src 'self' https://vercel.live/;
        `
    }

    // for production environment white-list vitals.vercel-insights
    // based on: https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#content-security-policy
    if (process.env.VERCEL_ENV === 'production') {
        return `
            ${defaultCSPDirectives}
            font-src 'self';
            style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
            script-src 'self';
            connect-src 'self' https://vitals.vercel-insights.com ${reportingDomainWildcard};
            img-src 'self';
            frame-src 'none';
        `
    }

    // for dev environment enable unsafe-eval for hot-reload
    return `
        ${defaultCSPDirectives}
        font-src 'self';
        style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
        script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
        connect-src 'self';
        img-src 'self' data:;
        frame-src 'none';
    `

}

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    poweredByHeader: false,
    experimental: {
        // currently false as mdx pages are not typed in prod builds (yet)
        typedRoutes: false,
    },
    headers: async () => {
        return [
            {
                source: '/(.*)',
                headers: [
                    {
                        key: cspReportOnly ? 'Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only' : 'Content-Security-Policy',
                        value: cspHeader().replace(/\n/g, ''),
                    },
                ],
            },
        ]
    },
};
```

If you now start your development server (using `npm run dev`), open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, then open the browsers developer tools and then click on the Console tab, then you should see no CSP violations messages

> [!NOTE]  
> To check for best practices I used a tool by google called [CSP Evaluator](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/), it showed a green checkmark for every directive except the **script-src** directive, where it mentioned that it would be better to remove **'unsafe-inline'**, however unsafe-inline is there because next.js uses inline scripts a lot

Lets edit the CSP rules we just added an make the **script-src** directive stricter by not using **'unsafe-eval'** as recommended by the CSP Evaluator service, like so:

```js title="next.config.mjs" {6}#special
    // for dev environment enable unsafe-eval for hot-reload
    return `
        ${defaultCSPDirectives}
        font-src 'self';
        style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
        script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
        connect-src 'self';
        img-src 'self' data:;
        frame-src 'none';
    `
```

Go back into the browser and check the console again, you should now be able to see a bunch of errors like these:

{/* eslint-disable-next-line mdx/remark */}
> [Report Only] Refused to evaluate a string as JavaScript because 'unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of script in the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'".

Those violations are there because Next.js attempts to inject javascript code used by development scripts like the Hot Module Reload (HMR) tool, which is a tool that reloads our page every time we save a file, for HMR to work we need to re-add the **'unsafe-eval'** value to the **script-src** rule, do that now and then save the file to fix violations again

If you look closer at what rule sets we created, there are a total of 4, the first one contains several default rules that we will use for our 3 environments, then we have some rules that we will only apply if the environment is **preview** which is the case when we deploy the preview branch on vercel, the next group contains the rules for the production environment and the last group has the rules we use for our local development environment

If you look at the `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'` rule we just edited for **development** you will see that we added the `'unsafe-eval'` value, now compare it with the `script-src` we use for the **production** and the rule we use for the **preview** environments and you will see that there we don't add that value, this is because scripts like HMR are only used in development, by not adding that exception to production and preview we make those two environments safer

> [!TIP]  
> I recommend you always start with the most restrictive rules possible, for example if you look at the top of CSP rules, I have set the **form-action** to none, this is because in this tutorial we will not have any forms so there is no reason to allow them, however if you add forms to your project in the future then you will of course want to adjust the directive and for example set it to 'self' instead of 'none'

Next if we look at the top of the configuration you will see that we set a variable **cspReportOnly** to **true**:

```js title="next.config.mjs" showLineNumbers {3}
// CSP headers here is set based on Next.js recommendations:
// https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy
const cspReportOnly = true;
```

and then at the end of the configuration file we use that variable, like so:

```js title="next.config.mjs" {14}
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    poweredByHeader: false,
    experimental: {
        // currently false as mdx pages are not typed in prod builds (yet)
        typedRoutes: false,
    },
    headers: async () => {
        return [
            {
                source: '/(.*)',
                headers: [
                    {
                        key: cspReportOnly ? 'Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only' : 'Content-Security-Policy',
                        value: cspHeader().replace(/\n/g, ''),
                    },
                ],
            },
        ]
    },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

Depending on the value of **cspReportOnly**, we either set the CSP header to **Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only** mode (if cspReportOnly = true) or we set it to **Content-Security-Policy** (if cspReportOnly = false)

This is because CSP has two modes, one that will ONLY report violations, this is good for testing your rules before actually enforcing them and a second mode which will enforce the rules

> [!NOTE]  
> when enforcing is enabled it will still report the violations (besides enforcing them)  

For now we set the CSP mode to only report violations, however as soon as are confident that there are no more violations it is recommend to set our custom variable **cspReportOnly** to **false**

### logging CSP violations

You should log CSP violations, same as you log errors happening in your code, to ensure they don't go unnoticed and be able to fix them in a timely manner as those violations if enforced are probably creating bugs on website

There are several logging service providers that offer logging CSP violations, in this tutorial I will use Sentry.io as it is already the tool we use for error logging, however feel free to chose another provider if you find one you prefer or even create your CSP violations logging tool if you have the capacity to develop, host and maintain such a project

#### Why Sentry.io (is not yet) the ideal solution (and why we will still use it)

On a lot of places (when reading about Sentry.io CSP violation logging) including in their own documentation (as of now 01.04.2024) you will read that it is recommended to use both the **report-to** as well as **report-uri** as fallback

This works for firefox that does not yet support report-to but does support report-uri, so firefox will fallback and use report-uri

However this does not use when using chrome (or any chromium based browser like edge and brave), chrome (>96) will attempt to use the **report-to directive** (defined as fallback in the Sentry.io documentation example), but chrome will assume you are using the **Reporting-Endpoints header** from the Reporting API v1, however the Sentry.io example uses the **Report-To header** from the Reporting API v0 which chrome (>96) does not support (anymore), meaning chrome will queue the reports and then attempt to send them, but as it will not find a valid endpoint definition the requests will fail (chrome will put their status back to "Queued" for another attempt and after a while will put the status to "MarkedForRemoval") and after failing to send the reports chrome will never fall back to using the **report-uri directive**, you might be tempted to replace the **Report-To header** from the Sentry.io example with the new **Reporting-Endpoints header** however Sentry.io does not support the Reporting-Endpoints header yet, so that's also not an option

> [!TIP]  
> For a more in depth look at the evolution of CSP and violation logging I recommend checking out my [CSP post](/web_development/posts/csp)

In the next chapter will use [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) that we have set up earlier for error logging purposes and add CSP violations logging, however we will only use the report-uri directive from the CSP v1 specification as this solution works in chrome, firefox and safari

> [!NOTE]  
> Keep an eye on CSP violation logging techniques as browsers and logging services will one after the other start supporting the Reporting API v1 and when they all do I recommend replacing the report-uri directive with the report-to directive and the Reporting-Endpoints header

The major drawback when using the report-uri directive is that it makes a request to your logging service for each violation it finds (the new reporting API v1 queues violations and then sends them all in one batch to the loggin service), which is why I recommend to only enable logging periodically, to ensure that you are not using up your entire quota in just a few hours / days, if you look at big web platforms you will notice that they even though they have CSP rules they also often remove the reporting when not needed and only turn it on when there is a bug and they suspect the CSP rules to be the cause

#### Setting up CSP violations logging using Sentry.io

First you need to visit Sentry.io and copy the CSP reporting URL of your project:

* visit Sentry.io and log in
* in the left navigation on the bottom click on **Settings**
* Then in the Settings navigation on the left click on **Projects**
* Click on the project name
* Then in navigation on the left, under **SDK SETUP**, click on **Security Headers**
* On the **Security Header Reports** page, copy the URL under **REPORT URI**
* finally replace the URL for the **const reportingUrl = ''** in the following code by the CSP reporting URL of your project

To make sure violations are being sent to Sentry.io (logged like any other error), we need to edit our CSP headers in the next.config.mjs file, like so:

```js title="next.config.mjs" {5-6} {13-15} {45} {60}
// CSP headers here is set based on Next.js recommendations:
// https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy
const cspReportOnly = true;

const reportingUrl = 'https://o4504017992482816.ingest.sentry.io/api/4506763918770176/security/?sentry_key=daf0befe66519725bbe2ad707a11bbb3'
const reportingDomainWildcard = 'https://*.ingest.sentry.io'

const cspHeader = () => {

    const upgradeInsecure = cspReportOnly ? '' : 'upgrade-insecure-requests;'

    // reporting uri (CSP v1)
    const reportCSPViolations = `
        report-uri ${reportingUrl};
    `

    // worker-src is for sentry replay
    // child-src is because safari <= 15.4 does not support worker-src
    const defaultCSPDirectives = `
        default-src 'none';
        media-src 'self';
        object-src 'none';
        worker-src 'self' blob:;
        child-src 'self' blob:;
        manifest-src 'self';
        base-uri 'none';
        form-action 'none';
        require-trusted-types-for 'script';
        frame-ancestors 'none';
        ${upgradeInsecure}
    `

    // when environment is preview enable unsafe-inline scripts for vercel preview feedback/comments feature
    // and whitelist vercel's domains based on:
    // https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/specialized-usage#using-a-content-security-policy
    // and white-list vitals.vercel-insights
    // based on: https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#content-security-policy
    if (process.env.VERCEL_ENV === 'preview') {
        return `
            ${defaultCSPDirectives}
            font-src 'self' https://vercel.live/;
            style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://vercel.live/fonts;
            script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://vercel.live/;
            connect-src 'self' https://vercel.live/ https://vitals.vercel-insights.com https://*.pusher.com/ wss://*.pusher.com/ ${reportingDomainWildcard};
            img-src 'self' data: https://vercel.com/ https://vercel.live/;
            frame-src 'self' https://vercel.live/;
            ${reportCSPViolations}
        `
    }

    // for production environment white-list vitals.vercel-insights
    // based on: https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#content-security-policy
    if (process.env.VERCEL_ENV === 'production') {
        return `
            ${defaultCSPDirectives}
            font-src 'self';
            style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
            script-src 'self';
            connect-src 'self' https://vitals.vercel-insights.com ${reportingDomainWildcard};
            img-src 'self';
            frame-src 'none';
            ${reportCSPViolations}
        `
    }

    // for dev environment enable unsafe-eval for hot-reload
    return `
        ${defaultCSPDirectives}
        font-src 'self';
        style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
        script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
        connect-src 'self';
        img-src 'self' data:;
        frame-src 'none';
    `

}
```

> [!WARN]  
> It is very important to add report url to the connect-src directive or it will get blocked by your CSP setup

What we have done is adding two variables, to store the Sentry.io CSP logging URL and a wildcard for the Sentry.io ingest sub-domain

The first variable contains the CSP logging URL **https://foo123.ingest.sentry.io/api/bar456/security/?sentry_key=baz789** is the same for preview and prod, it is the endpoint URL where the reports will get sent to, which means we use that variable to tell the report-uri directive where to send CSP violations reports

The second variable contains a wildcard for the sentry domain so that we can add the domain to our connect-src directive

We use the second varibale at the our our connect-src directive to whitelist the Sentry CSP logging URL, if we would not add the sub-domain wildcard to connect-src then the browser would block the CSP reports

> [!NOTE]  
> I only added the report-uri directive to preview and production but NOT development as Sentry.io will filter out reports from localhost anyway, if you want to debug your code you might want to add the reporting also for development, in that case add the `${reportCSPViolations}` variable to the development directives too (same as for preview and production) and then check out the chapter about [disableng the "reports from locahost" filter](/web_development/posts/sentry-io/#disable-the-reports-from-locahost-filter) in my Sentry.io post

### Adding security headers in Next.js configuration

While at it, lets add a 3 more security headers to our Next.js configuration...

#### convert nextConfig into a function

To be able to know what the current environement is, you could use Node.js [process.env](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/command-line/how-to-read-environment-variables-from-nodejs) **NODE_ENV** environment variable, however you need to know that this variable will on only ever have two states, when using the `npm run dev` command (the dev server) then this variable is development, this is still ok and else Next.js will always set **NODE_ENV** to production

Another option if like me you deploy on Vercel, then you can use the **VERCEL_ENV** variable, which is **devlopment** when running your project locally or **preview** when devploying a preview on Vercel and **production** when deploying a production build on Vercel

The third way to know the current context, is to use the Next.js config property called **phase**, to access the phase property we need to convert our configuration from an object into a function

In the previous examples the **nextConfig** variable was an **object**, we had a configuration that looked like this:

```mjs
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {}

export default nextConfig;
```

To get the phase **phase** property we need to convert **nextConfig** into a **function**, so that we get a configuration that looks like this:

```mjs
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = (phase) => {
    const nextConfigOptions = {}
    return nextConfigOptions
}

export default nextConfig;
```

Now that we have access to the **phase** we can use the [next/constants](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/5e6b008b561caf2710ab7be63320a3d549474a5b/packages/next/shared/lib/constants.ts#L19-L23) to check what the current context is, like so:

```mjs
import { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } from 'next/constants.js'

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = (phase) => {

    const nextConfigOptions = {
        poweredByHeader: false,
        experimental: {
            // experimental typescript "statically typed links"
            // https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript#statically-typed-links
            typedRoutes: phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER ? true : false,
        },
    }

    return nextConfigOptions
}

export default nextConfig;
```

In this example we check if the phase is **development** by using the **PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER** constant and if it is we enable the typedRoutes and if it is not the development server we disable the routes types

> [Vercel "system environment variables" documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/system-environment-variables)

#### next configuration security headers

Now that we have access to the phase property we can change the config to this:

```js title="next.config.mjs" {2} {4-11} {25} {30-41}
const nextConfig = (phase) => {

    // security headers for preview & production
    const extraSecurityHeaders = []

    if (phase !== PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER) {
        extraSecurityHeaders.push(
            {
                key: 'Strict-Transport-Security',
                value: 'max-age=31536000', // 1 year
            },
        )
    }

    /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
    const nextConfigOptions = {
        poweredByHeader: false,
        experimental: {
            // currently false as mdx pages are not typed in prod builds (yet)
            typedRoutes: false,
        },
        headers: async () => {
            return [
                {
                    source: '/(.*)',
                    headers: [
                        ...extraSecurityHeaders,
                        {
                            key: cspReportOnly ? 'Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only' : 'Content-Security-Policy',
                            value: cspHeader().replace(/\n/g, ''),
                        },
                        {
                            key: 'Referrer-Policy',
                            value: 'same-origin',
                        },
                        {
                            key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
                            value: 'nosniff',
                        },
                        {
                            key: 'X-Frame-Options',
                            value: 'deny',
                        },
                    ],
                },
            ];
        },
    }

    return nextConfigOptions

}
```

First we added a new variable `extraSecurityHeaders` to store the HSTS header as we want to exclude it in development where we don't have an SSL certificate

The HSTS header (`Strict-Transport-Security`) will tell the browser that this app only supports HTTPS, meaning that we want the browser to always use HTTPS for every page request even if in the page URL the scheme is HTTP

We also add 3 more headers by to the end of our headers array:

* the first one is a `Referrer-Policy` header tells the browser when and when NOT to include information about the origin in referrer header, the [MDN "Referrer-Policy" documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy) does a very good at explaining the different values, I like to only set the referrer for internal pages but not for external pages, that's why I use the value **same-origin**
* the second **X-Content-Type-Options** header tells the browser to not attempt to guess the MIME type of resource by itself 
* and finally the third `X-Frame-Options` header when set to **deny** does the same thing as the **frame-ancestors** directive (we added earlier) when set to **none**, but it is for older browsers that did not have support for the directive

## Adding MDX support using @next/mdx

As a developer using markdown to format content makes sense, as most of us probably already know Markdown because we have been using it when formatting our project READMEs, or when opening Issues or participating in Discussions on GitHub, this is why I chose to use MDX for this "static Next.js blog" project

To add MDX support to the Next.js blog I will use [@next/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx) which is an MDX package by the same team that is behind Next.js, but there are other alternatives that work well too, I listed some of them in the [@next/mdx alternatives chapter](/web_development/posts/mdx/#nextmdx-alternatives) in my MDX post, if you prefer you can also create your own package in which case I recommend you start by reading the **Deep Dive: How do you transform markdown into HTML?** section of the [next.js "Markdown and MDX" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx#deep-dive-how-do-you-transform-markdown-into-html)

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to get more background information about MDX I recommended checking out my [MDX post](/web_development/posts/mdx) first

**@next/mdx** is stable and I had no major problems using it for this project, there are however a series of open Issues on GitHub, I recommend having a brief look at the [@next/mdx issues search on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22area%3A+MDX%22) to have an idea of what might not work or just have a look at the list when you have the feeling something is not working as it should

### MDX support setup

is this still needed???:
```ts
// types/mdx.d.ts
declare module '*.mdx' {
    let MDXComponent: (props) => JSX.Element
    export default MDXComponent
}
```

### Our first MDX article (page)
