# Tutorial: Next.js static MDX blog

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]  
> Everything listed here is optional, if for example you already have a GitHub account then you can skip that step or if you prefer to install another IDE then the one I suggest then feel free to do so

you will need a GitHub account to store your code, which will make it easy to access your code on multiple devices, share your code with others and later on we will connect our GitHub to other services likes Vercel.com to set up an automatic CI/CD pipeline to deploy our code:

* [create a GitHub account](/web_development/posts/github)

after creating a GitHub account we will need to create a repository on GitHub for our Code:

* [create a new GitHub repository](/web_development/posts/github)

next to be able to write code we will need an IDE, my preferred IDE to write Javascript (Typescript) code is VSCode, so go ahead and install VSCode:

* [install VSCode](/web_development/posts/vscode)

now that we have installed the VSCode IDE we will login to GitHub in VSCode:

* [install VSCode](/web_development/posts/vscode)

now that we have connect our GitHub account in VSCode we will be easy to check out (make a local copy / clone) our GitHub repository, which will allow us to work on our code and commit the changes on a regular basis back to our GitHub repository:

* [install VSCode](/web_development/posts/vscode)
