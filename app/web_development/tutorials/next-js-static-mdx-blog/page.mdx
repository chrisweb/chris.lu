# Tutorial: Next.js static MDX blog

![banner image displaying a voodoo lady mixing potions in a big cauldron, it represents a dev using different packages to build a project using an IDE](../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-mdx-blog/banner.png 'when two files meet in git diff')

In this tutorial we will:

* create static pages using the Next.js (v13.x/14.x) app directory
* create several components using React (v18.x)
* add support for MDX content formatting via the @next/mdx package
* add a plugin to automatically generate a table of contents for each post
* add another plugin will handle code blocks styling based on your favorite VSCode template
* add yet another plugin will allow us to GitHub like alerts to our content
* add linting tools for both the code of the project and the content of the posts
* add a CI/CD pipeline using vercel.com so that every time we commit code to our GitHub repository it gets automatically deployed

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Prerequisites** chapter is for beginners, if for example you already have a GitHub account then you can skip that step or if you prefer to install another IDE then the one I suggest then feel free to do so

First we need a **GitHub account** to store our code in a GitHub repository (if you prefer to use another serive like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), feel free to do so), which will make it easy to access your code on multiple devices and will also allow us to share your code with others. Later on we will use the GitHub to sign in to services like Vercel.com to set up an automatic CI/CD pipeline that will automatically deploy our code and sign up for a Sentry.io to add error monitoring, so that when a user encounters a bug it gets listed with a stacktrace in Sentry.io

* [create a GitHub account](/web_development/posts/github)

After creating a GitHub account need to **create a repository** on GitHub for our Code:

* [create a new GitHub repository](/web_development/posts/github#create-a-repository)

Next we need to **install git**, which is a version control tool which will get used by VSCode:

* [install git](/web_development/posts/git)

Next to be able to write code we need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), my preferred IDE to write Javascript (Typescript) code is VSCode (Visual Studio Code):

* [install VSCode](/web_development/posts/vscode)

Now we need to sign in to our GitHub account in VSCode and use the VSCode source control tool to make a local clone of our GitHub repository:

* [clone GitHub repository in VSCode](/web_development/posts/vscode#cloning-your-github-repository-in-vscode)

To be able to create a Javascript backend and run our Javascript code locally we need to install the Node.js runtime:

* [install Node.js (and npm)](/web_development/posts/node-js)

> [!NOTE]  
> the **next.js 14** "app directory features" require nodejs v18.17 or later, so if you skipped the Node.js installation document because you already have Node.js installed, then just make sure you have a version installed that is high enough, to do that you can for example use the following command: `node -v{:shell}`

## The road to server components and server actions

React and Next.js have evolved a lot lately, the most notable additions are **server components** and **server actions**, on this page I try to list all the updates that happend during the last +-2 years in the React and Next.js ecosystem, so if you did not build a project with Next.js 13/14 yet I recommend you check it out, but if you are already an expert feel free to skip this chapter üòâ

* [the road to React and Next.js server components and server actions](/web_development/posts/road-to-react-next-js-server-side-features)

## Getting started

If you closed VSCode since last time, launch VSCode and open the folder we created in **Prerequisites** chapter (if you need help to open a folder in VSCode, check out my chapter [open a folder in VSCODE](/web_development/posts/vscode#open-a-folder-in-vscode) from the VSCode post)

### create a new "preview" git branch

There are a lot of different approaches when it comes to managing code using branches, like [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), [GitLab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/), [Trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development) and many more. There is no right or wrong here, the best workflow is the one that works best for you (or for your team), this is why I recommend checking out the above links and familiarize yourself with the different workflows, then try the one out that you think is best suited and if it does not fit perfectly you can still adjust and make it your git flow üòâ

Because this project is about a personal blog, I don't think we need a very complex Git Flow, this is why I will only create a second branch to commit the code updates into and then be able to preview the result (staging or testing environment), then if I'm satisfied with the result I will make a pull request (PR) to merge the code into the main branch, the main branch will then get deployed in production. If you work with others on your blog project, to avoid having to deal with merge conflicts on a regular basis, you might want to create a branch per feature (hence called feature branches) and use that branch for development, but if you are the only dev a **main** branch as well as an extra **preview** branch is probably enough.

Create a new branch **from the main branch** and call it **preview**, to learn how to create a new branch from another branch (and then publish it), I recommend you check the chapter ["Creating a new branch" from the VSCode post](/web_development/posts/vscode#create-a-new-branch-from-based-on-another-branch) in my VSCode post

Now that the branch is created, you will see in the bottom of VSCode that our new branch is already the one selected, it is not published yet, so go ahead and publish it (yes you could consider not publishing it until you are sure that you will use the code, but I prefer to always immediatly publish them, so that if something happens to my computer I still have a copy in the cloud, of course once published it is a bit more work if you want to delete it as you need to do so locally as well as remotly but I still prefer that to losing several hours or even days worth of work)

### using Create Next App (CNA)

To create a new Next.js project we are going to use [Create Next App](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-next-app) (CNA), CNA is a CLI tool created by the Next.js to get started quickly

> [!NOTE]  
> we will create the new project in the root of our directory (not a sub-directory), so make sure there is no README.md file in the directory yet, as the create-next-app tool we will use will create one and if it finds a README.md it will abort, if there is a README.md file, first delete it and then commit the changes (if you need help to commit changes using VSCode, check out my chapter [commit your changes to GitHub using the VSCode version control tool](/web_development/posts/vscode#commit-your-changes-to-github-using-the-vscode-version-control-tool) from the VSCode post)

> [!TIP]  
> I will use the option `--use-npm{:shell}`, if you prefer using another package manager you can change the option to `--use-pnpm{:shell}` for [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), `--use-yarn{:shell}` for [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or `--use-bun{:shell}` for [bun](https://bun.sh/package-manager)

Make sure the VSCode terminal is open (if you need help to open the terminal in VSCode, check out my chapter [open a VSCode terminal](/web_development/posts/vscode#open-a-vscode-terminal) from the VSCode post) and then enter the following command and then press `ENTER{:shell}`:

```shell title="terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest ./ --use-npm
```

**Create Next App** will tell you it needs to be installed first, accept by typing `y{:shell}` and then press `ENTER{:shell}`

Next you will get asked some more questions so that Next.js knows what it needs to install and set up for you:

* **Would you like to use TypeScript?**, I recommended leaving it to **Yes** which is what is preselected, if however you prefer to use javascript select **No** using the left / right arrow keys and then just press `ENTER{:shell}` (I recommend to use Typescript but I will not argue in favor or against it here, this is not the right place, if you never used Typescript before, then maybe just give it a try and see for yourself how different it is from using Javascript and after having built this blog prototype you will be able to judge for yourself which one you like more)
* **Would you like to use ESLint?**, again **Yes** is preselected, so just press `ENTER{:shell}` ([ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is very useful tool that helps find and correct errors in your code)
* **Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?**, I will set this to **No**,  press `‚Üê` (the left arrow key) and then `ENTER{:shell}`, I will use another styling solution in this project, more on that later) so if you want to explore another solution with me through this project then select "No" too, if you know Tailwind CSS and want to use it instead feel free to keep it on "Yes"
* **Would you like to use `src/` directory?** I will leave this on **No** and then press `ENTER{:shell}`, if prefer to place all your code in an `src/` directory then press the `‚Üí` right arrow key to select "Yes", some people prefer it for example to be able to restrict searches in files to files that are in the `src/` directory and hence avoid getting result from the node_modules folder, my personal preference is to not use it as it is not required, I like to have all my directories in the root and if needed I can exclude the node_modules directory which is the same amount of work as including src instead
* **Would you like to use App Router?** definatly keep this on **Yes** and then press `ENTER{:shell}`, since Next.js 13 you have two directories to chose from, you can add your pages into the **pages** directory which is the older version or you use the more modern version, which is the **app** directory, I recommend enabling the app directory (you can still later create the pages directory manually if you want to use it, both can be used alongside each other
* **Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)?** press `‚Üí` (the right arrow key) to select **Yes** and then press `ENTER{:shell}`, this will tell CNA to add an alias for a given path in the `tsconfig.json` (the Typescript configuration file) if you selected **TypeScript** in the first question and if you chose **Javascript** it will create the alias in the `jsconfig.json` file (This alias can be used for imports as a replacement for a path to a dependency, to learn more about this feature I recommend you have a quick look at the [Next.js "Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases)), if however you don't want it feel free to leave it on "No"
* **What import alias would you like configured?** I personally keep the default `@/*`, but feel free to chose another one if you prefer, then press `ENTER{:shell}`

That's it the **Create Next App** will now install Next.js and React (and React DOM) for us, it will then add some development dependencies based on what we chose, like Typescript and ESLint and then it will add some default configuration files for each of these tools

> [!TIP]  
> when you use CNA, some of the options you chose will get stored, so that next time you use it again it will take your stored preferences instead of default values, if you want to reset those stored preferences you can use the `--reset-preferences{:shell}` option like so `npx create-next-app --reset-preferences{:shell}`, if successful CNA will print the following message "**Preferences reset successfully**"

> [Next.js "Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases)

### first commit

Now that create next app is done, it is a good time to do your first commit

If you need help to commit changes (and then synchronize them) using VSCode, check out my chapter [commit your changes to GitHub using the VSCode version control tool](/web_development/posts/vscode#commit-your-changes-to-github-using-the-vscode-version-control-tool) from the VSCode post

After you have commited the files and synchronised the changes with remote repository, you can go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and check out your repository or go directly to your repository if you remember the name, the URL should be in the format `https://github.com/MY_GITHUB_USER_NAME/MY_REPOSITORY_NAME`, by default the content of the **main** branch gets displayed and because we commited our changes into the **preview** branch you need switch to the **preview** branch on GitHub to see your files (if you don't know how to switch branches on GitHub check out the [switch branches](/web_development/posts/github#switch-branches) chapter in my GitHub post)

If the commit and syncing was successful you will see that all the new files and directories are now listed in your GitHub repository

> [!TIP]  
> I recommend you commit often as it will make it a lot easier if you decide to revert your last commit, because it will only include the code from one step you want to undo and NOT also the code of several other steps that you actually want to keep, it will also create a nicer commit history where the commit messages are short and related to a few files instead if having a huge commit messages attached to dozens of files, also commiting and synchronising often reduces the risk that you lose code and hence hours or days of work if something happens to your local machine and finally it reduces the risk that you end of having conflits if you are not the only one working on the repository

### update the README.md file

> [!NOTE]  
> for your future self and for others that might contribute on your project it is always helpful to have well documented project. This is why we will update the readme and place some documentation in it, if however you prefer to store such information somewhere else this is fine too, what really matters is to do update the documentation regulary so that it will not become a tedious task at some point and also is a helpful resource right from the start of your project

The first file we will edit is the `README.md`, I recommend you remove everything that is currently in the REAME.md (not that it is bad advice but we will just structure it differently and add some more information to it)

Then copy / paste the following content into your README:

```md
# MY_PROJECT

## npm commands (package.json scripts)

`npm run dev`: to start the development server  
`npm run build`: to make a production build  
`npm run start`: to start the server on a production server using the build we made with the previous command  
`npm run lint`: to run a linting script that will scan our code and help us find problems in our code  

```

> [!TIP]  
> I added 2 spaces after each line, for the 4 commands, this ensures that there is a line break after each of them  

This adds documentation to the README for 4 commands that are available after setting up a project with CNA

Then change **MY_PROJECT** to whatever you want to name your project

> [!TIP]  
> Did you know you can preview markdown files in VSCode? If not check out my short [mardown preview chapter](/web_development/posts/vscode#vscode-markdown-preview) in the VSCode post  

Now save the file (to save the file you can use the VSCode shortcut `Ctrl+S{:shell}` (macOS: `‚åòS{:shell}`, Linux: `Ctrl+S{:shell}`))

Finally commit the changes and then synchronize them

## creating a simple blog

### create the first page

Hope you are still there, because it is finally time to start coding (a bit) üôÇ

But first lets open the app directory create next app has created for us, if you have a bit of time have a look at what they put in there (it's always good to have a look at what the Next.js team recommends) but after that delete all the files in the `/app` directory as I want to go step by step through the process of creating a Next.js blog, you can also delete the content in the `/public` directory as we won't need the assets of the demo project anymore

Next create a new file in the app directory and name it `page.tsx` (or `page.jsx` if you chose to use javascript)

Then add the following content into the `page.tsx` file and finally save it

```tsx title="/app/page.tsx" showLineNumbers
export default function Home() {

    return (
        <>
            <h1>Hello World?</h1>
        </>
    )

}

```

Congratulations you just coded your first Next.js page

### start the dev(elopment) server

Now open the VSCode terminal if it isn't open yet (or use your favorite command line tool) and let's use one of the 4 commands we added to our README.md earlier to start the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Now in the terminal, press `Ctrl` and then click on the Next.js local server URL or open your browser and put the following URL into the address bar: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

> [!NOTE]  
> port 3000 is the default, the port will be something else if:  
>
> * it was already in use Next.js will have taken another port  
> * you have used the **-p** option for next.js **dev** or **start** cli commands, for example in your package.json use the option like so `next dev -p 4000` to change the port to 4000
>
> if you want to know for sure what port is being used check the terminal, Next.js will have printed the URL of the dev server

If you inspect the source of the page, you will see that Next.js injects a bunch of Javascript code into our page and some of those javascript files are really heavy, this is because Next.js adds for example a tool called **Hot Module Reload** (HMR), which will run in the background and update the project for us every time we edit and then save a file in our project, Next.js calls this [fast refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/fast-refresh), then it will reload the content in the browser for us, all of that code however won't make it into production, Next.js only adds those tool when in development mode (we are in development mode because we use the dev server command)

Now go back to VSCode and look at the list of files in the sidebar and you will notice that Next.js re-added the `/app/layout.tsx` file we just deleted earlier, that's because Next.js is a nice framework and it will always have your back, well and also because this layout file is called the **root layout** and it is **required**, also if you look at your VSCode terminal you will see that Next.js printed the following line, informing us that it created the layout file for us:

> Your page app/page.tsx did not have a root layout. We created app\layout.tsx for you.

If you open the file you will see that on top it has added a metadata object, this Next.js metadata API is what we will use in layouts and pages to modify the tags in the `<head>` element of our page(s), like the **title** and **description** (I will go more in detail in a future chapter)

The second part it has added is just a basic React setup

```tsx title="/app/layout.tsx" {1-4} showLineNumbers
export const metadata = {
    title: 'Next.js',
    description: 'Generated by Next.js',
}

export default function RootLayout({
    children,
}: {
    children: React.ReactNode
}) {
    return (
        <html lang="en">
            <body>{children}</body>
        </html>
    )
}

```

> [Next.js "Metadata API" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata)  

### edit the first page

As you might have noticed I added a question mark in the **Hello World?** heading text, let's replace the question mark with an exclamation mark and then save the file

> [!NOTE]  
> as soon as you save the file, you will see in the terminal that Next.js prints a message **Compiled in Xms (Y modules)**, which shows you that Next.js detected changes in your code base and did a new build for you

Now go back into your browser and even though you haven't reloaded the page you will notice that your changes have been applied

Time to make another commit (and sync the changes) and then call it a day üòâ
