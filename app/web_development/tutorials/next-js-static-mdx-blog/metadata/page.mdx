# Metadata (for tsx and mdx pages)

In this chapter, we will add **metadata** to our pages (and layout) by using the [Next.js Metadata API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata), this will add meta tags inside of the `<head>{:html}` element of our HTML documents, which is essential to help the crawlers from search engines and social networks better understand the content of our pages. These efforts will result in improved SEO scores, which means we will be getting more traffic from organic sources

As we saw early in this tutorial, Next.js has created a `layout.tsx` file in the `/app` folder and already added a basic **metadata** object

## Metadata in layouts

We start by editing the `layout.tsx` file to add some entries to the metadata object:

```tsx title="/app/layout.tsx" showLineNumbers {7-10} {11}
import './global.css'
import { Metadata } from 'next'
import HeaderNavigation from '@/components/header/Navigation'
import { Kablammo } from 'next/font/google'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: {
        template: '%s | example.com',
        default: 'Home | example.com',
    },
    description: 'My description',
}
```

Lines 7 to 10: we edit the title meta tag, the default title value was previously a string, but we turned it into an object with two properties

Line 8: by using the [title.template](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#template) we ensure that all will titles have a similar structure on every page and it helps reduce repetition (DRY)

Line 9: the second property is the default title for the homepage (which is required, when using template)

The template will work for any pages that are in the same route segment as the layout, as this is the **root** layout of our project, it means the template will work on **all our pages**

When we visit one of pages, Next.js metadata will replace title.template `%s` placeholder with the title of the current page we are visiting

Line 11: we only changed the description default value to something else

Launch the dev server, then open the "home" page at `http://localhost:3000/`, and then right-click and select **inspect**

Look at what is inside your page's `<head>{:html}` element. There are, for example, some Next.js `<script>{:html}` tags, but also the following 4 tags are now present:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Home | example.com</title>
<meta name="description" content="My description">
```

The `viewport` tag gets always added to every page by default, but you can customize the **content** value of the viewport using the [generateViewport](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-viewport) function:

```tsx title="custom viewport example"
import type { Viewport } from 'next'
 
export const viewport: Viewport = {
	width: 'device-width',
	initialScale: 1,
	maximumScale: 1,
	userScalable: false,
}
```

The second `charset` tag gets also added by Next.js to every page

And then there are also the two metadata tags we added in the `layout.tsx` file, both **title** and **description** display the default values we have set in our layout

Now, let's have a look at the source code of our **home** page:

```tsx title="/app/page.tsx" showLineNumbers
export default function Home() {

    return (
        <>
            <h1>Hello World?</h1>
        </>
    )

}
```

As we saw when inspecting the `<head>{:html}` element of our page had meta tags, but our `page.tsx` file does not have any code related to the **metadata** object, this is because every page will inherit the metadata we have set in the layout, you only add a metadata object in the pages for which you want to override the default values from the layout or if you want to add a new metadata property that you didn't set in the layout

> [Next.js "" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-viewport)

## Metadata in typescript pages

Let's keep the **home** page as is and instead edit the second page we created earlier, which is the `/app/blog/page.tsx` file, and add some metadata to it:

```tsx title="/app/blog/page.tsx" showLineNumbers {1} {3-5}
import type { Metadata } from 'next'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: 'Blog page',
}

export default function Blog() {

    return (
        <>
            I&apos;m the blog page
        </>
    )
}
```

Line 1: we import the `Metadata` type to strictly type the metadata object

Lines 3 to 5: we create a `metadata` object and add a custom title for the blog page

Now launch the dev server, then open the **blog** page `http://localhost:3000/blog` in your browser, then right click and select **Inspect**

If you look at the meta tags you will notice that the title tag has used the template from our layout file and combined it with the custom title from the blog page. The description is unchanged, as we did NOT overwrite the default value from our layout

## Metadata in MDX pages

When I first experimented with the new metadata object, I was wondering if it would also work in MDX pages, and **YES**, it does 🎉

Let's edit the last **gfm playground page** we created earlier and add some metadata on top:

```md title="/app/(tutorial_examples)/gfm_playground/page.mdx" showLineNumbers {1-3}
export const metadata = {
    title: 'GFM playground page',
}

<div id="core">

```

Lines 1 to 3: we create a new **metadata** object and add a custom title for the GFM playground page (we do NOT import the `Metadata` type as MDX files are not typescript)

If you inspect the source of the playground page `http://localhost:3000/gfm_playground`, you will see the MDX page has the correct title (and also makes use of the template from the layout)

Congratulations 🎉 you just learned how to add metadata using layouts and pages

## Open Graph metadata

The [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/) is essential if you want to control what gets displayed when your content gets shared, but it is also helpful if you want to improve your SEO score. In the past, it was mostly regarded as a Facebook thing, but today a lot of social networks, messengers, search engines and a bunch of services will use the open graph data that your website provides

First, let's add a default **Open Graph** object to our **root layout** file:

```tsx title="/app/layout.tsx" showLineNumbers {12-17}
import './global.css'
import { Metadata } from 'next'
import HeaderNavigation from '@/components/header/Navigation'
import { Kablammo } from 'next/font/google'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: {
        template: '%s | example.com',
        default: 'Home | example.com',
    },
    description: 'My description',
    openGraph: {
        url: 'https://example.com/',
        siteName: 'My website name',
        locale: 'en_US',
        type: 'website',
    },
}
```

Lines 12 to 17: we add an **Open Graph** object and set a few properties, like the permalink **url** of the page, the projects (blog, wesite, ...) **site name**, the locale of the content and the **type** of content that it is 

> [!TIP]  
> As we already have a **title** and **description** in the regular metadata, we do NOT need to repeat those in the open graph data, Next.js will handle this automatically for us

Next, let's also add a metadata example to our **GFM playground**:

```md title="/app/(tutorial_examples)/gfm_playground/page.mdx" showLineNumbers {2-5}
export const metadata = {
    title: 'GFM playground page',
    openGraph: {
        url: 'https://example.com/tutorial_examples/gfm_playground',
    },
}
```

Lines 2 to 5: we overwrite the URL property of the **Open Graph** layout metadata with the permalink of the current page

Now inspect the source of the playground page `http://localhost:3000/gfm_playground`, you will see that in the `<head>{:html}` element of our page there are the following tags:

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="GFM playground page | example.com">
<meta property="og:description" content="My description">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/tutorial_examples/gfm_playground">
```

I expected to see 6 meta tags, but there are only 3, which means the **openGraph** object from the page did not get merged with the **openGraph** object of the layout. At first, I thought this was a bug, so I did a search in the Next.js issues in the Next.js GitHub repository and found an Issue [Next.js issue "openGraph metadata not merging across layouts" #47540](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/47540) and then 2 more [Next.js issue "All properties of nested metadata objects like openGraph get overwritten even if only one was a duplicate" #46899](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/46899), [Next.js issue "Nested Open Graph metadata overwrites root metadata" #46434](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/46434) about problems when merging **openGraph** of a page with the one of the layout. The issues all have comments which seem to indicate that this by design and it is not something they plan to change, as explained in this [comment by a member of the Nextj.js team](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/47540#issuecomment-1533106646).

### 3 ways to merge Open Graph metadata

There are **3** different workarounds to merge Open Graph meta data, I will start with the most obvious one and end with one that is a bit more complex:

**Solution 1**: we can repeat the open graph values in every page, in which we use the **static** metadata export, this means manually copying the open graph we already set in the layout and adding it again to the page itself:

```md title="/app/(tutorial_examples)/gfm_playground/page.mdx" showLineNumbers {5-7}
export const metadata = {
    title: 'GFM playground page',
    openGraph: {
        url: 'https://example.com/tutorial_examples/gfm_playground',
        siteName: 'My website name',
        locale: 'en_US',
        type: 'website',
    },
}
```

Lines 5 to 7: we manually re-add the Open Graph properties we already added in the layout

**Solution 2**: is to use the [generateMetadata](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#generatemetadata-function) function to get the parent open graph metadata object and extend it manually:

```md title="/app/(tutorial_examples)/gfm_playground/page.mdx" showLineNumbers
export async function generateMetadata(props, parent) {
    const parentOpenGraph = (await parent).openGraph
    return {
        title: 'GFM playground page',
        openGraph: {
            ...parentOpenGraph,
            url: 'https://example.com/tutorial_examples/gfm_playground'
        }
    }
}
```

When I saw the `await` in the above code, I was afraid that using this might opt the page out of **static rendering**, so I used the `npm run build` command to make a local test build and saw that it is **NOT** the case:

```shell
Route (app)                                          Size     First Load JS
└ ○ /tutorial_examples/gfm_playground                1.04 kB         191 kB
○  (Static)  prerendered as static content
```

The same code we added to the MDX page can be strictly typed if we add it to a typescript page, like so:

```tsx title="/app/blog/page.tsx" showLineNumbers
import type { Metadata, ResolvingMetadata } from 'next'

export async function generateMetadata(props: unknown, parent?: ResolvingMetadata):Promise<Metadata> {
    const parentOpenGraph = (await parent)?.openGraph
    return {
        title: 'Blog page',
        openGraph: {
            ...parentOpenGraph,
            url: 'https://example.com/blog'
        }
    }
}
```

**Solution 3**: as suggested in the [metadata merging documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#merging), create a file with default open graph values and then always import that file:

First, we create a new `shared` folder in the root of the project and then inside of it a `metadata.ts` file, into which we add the metadata including our open graph we want to use in every page:

```ts title="/shared/metadata.ts" showLineNumbers
import type { Metadata } from 'next'

export const sharedMetadata: Metadata = {
    openGraph: {
        url: 'https://example.com/',
        siteName: 'My website name',
        locale: 'en_US',
        type: 'website',
    }
}
```

Then we import the shared open graph file inside of our page(s):

```tsx title="/app/blog/page.tsx" showLineNumbers
import type { Metadata } from 'next'
import { sharedMetadata } from '@/shared/metadata'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: 'Blog page',
    openGraph: {
        ...sharedMetadata.openGraph,
        url: 'https://example.com/blog'
    }
}
```

> [!TIP]  
> Make sure the `sharedMetadata` variable is first in the `openGraph` so that what comes after overwrites the default values  

Congratulations 🎉 you now also have support for open graph metadata in your project
