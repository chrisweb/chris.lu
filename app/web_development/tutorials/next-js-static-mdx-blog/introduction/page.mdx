# Introduction

I tried to make this tutorial as beginner-friendly as possible. If, however you have a question feel free to ask on the <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faComments} size="1x" color='rgb(255, 0, 170)' /> [discussion](https://github.com/chrisweb/chris.lu/discussions) page and if you find a bug please report it using the <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBug} size="1x" color='rgb(255, 0, 170)' /> [issues](https://github.com/chrisweb/chris.lu/issues)

I have always wanted to create my own developer profile and not be limited by what I can do on social networks. My main goal was to create a blog (website) that is blazingly fast and has good DX so that I can add content quickly and don't have to spend countless hours doing maintenance. I documented every step while building my dream project and I'm happy to finally be able to share it with the community by publishing this tutorial

After I my first deployment in production went live I immediatly launched a lighthouse analysis and I'm glad the results matched my expectations:

![lighthouse analysis results showing a 100% score for performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO](../../../../../public/assets/images/app/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-mdx-blog/lighthouse.png)

## Preview

In this tutorial, we will:

* create a fully static site using the Next.js v14.x (compatible with v13.x) app directory
* create several components using React v18.x
* add support for MDX content formatting via the @next/mdx package
* add a plugin to generate a table of contents for each post automatically
* add another plugin that will handle code block styling based on your favorite VSCode theme
* add yet another plugin that will render GitHub like alerts, created using the github markdown syntax for alerts
* add linting tools for both the code and the content (markdown lint)
* add a CI/CD pipeline using Vercel.com so that every time we commit code to our GitHub repository, it gets automatically deployed (staging/production)
* add bugs monitoring and Content Security Policy (CSP) violations logging using Sentry.io
* install useful extensions for VSCode and learn how to use them

> [!NOTE]  
> I made this tutorial with total beginners in mind. However, if you are already an experienced Next.js dev, then there are some chapters you may want to skip
