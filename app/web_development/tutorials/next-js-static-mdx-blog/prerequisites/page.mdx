# Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]  
> The Next.js static MDX website **Prerequisites** chapter is for beginners
>  
> For example, if you already have a GitHub account, then you can skip that step, or if you prefer to install another IDE than the one I suggest, then feel free to do so

First, we need a **GitHub account** to store our code in a GitHub repository (if you prefer to use another service like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), feel free to do so), which will make it easy to access your code on multiple devices and will also allow us to share your code with others

Later on, we will use GitHub to sign in to services like Vercel.com to set up an automatic CI/CD pipeline that will automatically deploy our code and sign up for a Sentry.io to add error monitoring so that when a user encounters a bug, it gets listed with a stack trace in Sentry.io

* [create a GitHub account](/web_development/posts/github)

After creating a GitHub account, you need to **create a repository** on GitHub for our Code:

* [create a new GitHub repository](/web_development/posts/github#create-a-repository)

Next, we need to **install git**, which is a version control tool that VSCode will use:

* [install git](/web_development/posts/git)

Next, to be able to write code, we need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

My preferred IDE to write Javascript (Typescript) code is VSCode (Visual Studio Code):

* [install VSCode](/web_development/posts/vscode)

Now we need to sign in to our GitHub account in VSCode and use the VSCode source control tool to make a local clone of our GitHub repository:

* [clone GitHub repository in VSCode](/web_development/posts/vscode#cloning-your-github-repository-in-vscode)

To be able to create a Javascript backend and run our Javascript code locally, we need to install the Node.js runtime:

* [install Node.js (and npm)](/web_development/posts/node-js)

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Next.js 14** "app directory features" require Node.js v18.17 or later, so if you skipped the Node.js installation document because you already have Node.js installed, then just make sure you have a version installed that is high enough
>  
> To do that, you can, for example, use the following command: `node -v`

## The road to React 19 and Next.js 15

React and Next.js have evolved a lot lately ðŸš€

The most notable additions are **server components** and **(server) actions**. With those new features came a lot of changes for how we devs build Next.js apps/websites, which is why I did a separate blog post ["The road to React 19 and Next.js 15"](/web_development/posts/road-to-react-19-next-js-15) where I list what changed during the last +-3 years in the React and Next.js ecosystem

If you have not built a project with Next.js 13/14/15 and React 18/19 yet, I recommend you check it out, but if you are already an expert, feel free to skip it ðŸ˜‰
