# Error handling and logging

As we saw earlier, each route segment is a directory, and each directory contains a page file, but unlike the page router, when using the app router, we can add more than just pages, for example, one of those files we are about to add is an error page

How this works is that Next.js will automatically wrap the children of your page with a **React Error Boundary**, meaning that when an error gets thrown in a page, then the error boundary will contain it and then use the error file that is the closest (either an error file that is in the same directory as the page itself or a parent directory) as a fallback

Let's create our first error file inside of our app directory, and let's use the example from the Next.js documentation like so:

```ts title="app/error.tsx" showLineNumbers {13-16}
'use client' // Error components must be Client Components

import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function Error({
    error,
    reset,
}: {
    error: Error & { digest?: string }
    reset: () => void
}) {

    useEffect(() => {
        // Log the error to an error reporting service
        console.error(error)
    }, [error])

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Sorry, something went wrong 😞</h1>
            <button
                // Attempt to recover by trying to re-render the segment
                onClick={() => reset()} 
            >
                Try again
            </button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

Every time the component receives an error, it will use `console.log` to print the error in the console

The second feature of this component is that there is a `button` which will trigger the `reset` function we got from the component props, this function provided by Next.js will attempt to rerender the segment that triggered an error, this is helpful if the error was caused by something that occurs sporadically and might allow the user to continue

As you can see, the Next.js documentation example uses a `useEffect(){:.function}` function to log the error in our console, but what happens if the error is getting triggered on a user's computer, then we won't know about, so as Next.js suggests, in the second part of this chapter, we will use a third-party service called [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to do the logging for us (of course if you prefer you can also develop and run your logging service instead)

## Sentry.io SDK for Next.js setup

In this chapter, we will use [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) (which has a free plan for side projects) to add error logging to the Next.js error file we just created

First, you need to have or create an account on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) (if you need help with that step, check out my chapter [Create a Sentry account (sign up)](/web_development/posts/sentry-io#create-an-account-sign-up) in the Sentry.io post)

Now we need to create a new project on Sentry.io (if you need help with that step, check out my chapter [Create a Sentry.io project](/web_development/posts/sentry-io#create-a-sentryio-project) in the Sentry.io post)

Now that the project is created, we will use the Sentry.io Wizard tool to install the Sentry.io SDK for Next.js (if you need help with that step, check out my chapter [Sentry.io SDK for Next.js installation](/web_development/posts/sentry-io#sentryio-sdk-for-nextjs-installation) in the Sentry.io post)

After creating a Sentry.io project and setting up the SDK, I recommend also using the [Sentry.io integration on Vercel](https://vercel.com/integrations/sentry) as this will automate the part **"Adding the Sentry authentication token as an environment variable to your CI setup"** that we just saw when using the Sentry.io wizard (if you need help with that step, check out my chapter [Sentry integration for Vercel](/web_development/posts/vercel#sentry-integration-for-vercel) in the Vercel post)

Finally, now that you have installed the SDK, you might want to do some fine-tuning of the Sentry.io configuration (if you need help with that step, check out my chapter [Sentry.io for Next.js configuration](/web_development/posts/sentry-io#sentryio-for-nextjs-configuration) in the Sentry.io post)

## Error logging using Sentry.io

Now that Sentry.io is set up, we can modify the error file we created earlier and add import the Sentry SDK, and add the Sentry.io logging function inside of the `useEffect(){:.function}` to replace the example console.log, like so:

```tsx title="app/error.tsx" showLineNumbers {3} {14-17}
'use client' // Error components must be Client Components

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function Error({
    error,
    reset,
}: {
    error: Error & { digest?: string }
    reset: () => void
}) {

    useEffect(() => {
        // log the error to Sentry.io
        Sentry.captureException(error)
    }, [error])

    return (
        <>
            <h1>Sorry, something went wrong 😞</h1>
            <button
                onClick={() => reset()} // attempt to recover by trying to re-render the segment
            >
                Try again
            </button>
        </>
    )
}
```

## Handling global errors

The Sentry.io wizard we just used has created a Next.js `app/global-error.jsx` file for us

The Next.js documentation explains well why this file is essential:

> The root app/error.js boundary does not catch errors thrown in the root app/layout.js or app/template.js component.
>
> To specifically handle errors in these root components, use a variation of error.js called app/global-error.js located in the root app directory.
>
> global-error.js is the least granular error UI and can be considered "catch-all" error handling for the whole application.

But because Sentry created a **javascript** file, but our project uses **typescript**, we will start by converting the file into a typescript file by renaming `app/global-error.jsx` to `app/global-error.tsx`

After renaming the file, we edit it and replace its content with the code for a global error page from the Next.js documentation, which is a good start as it is strictly typed, the only difference is that we also modify the code to add the Sentry.io `captureException(){:.function}` function, that will capture exceptions and send them to Sentry.io, the final version looks like this:

```ts title="app/global-error.tsx" showLineNumbers
'use client' // Error components must be Client Components

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function GlobalError({
    error,
    reset,
}: {
    error: Error & { digest?: string }
    reset: () => void
}) {

    useEffect(() => {
        // log the error to Sentry.io
        Sentry.captureException(error)
    }, [error])

    return (
        <html>
            <body>
                <h1>Sorry, something went wrong 😞</h1>
                <button
                    onClick={() => reset()} // attempt to recover by trying to re-render the segment
                >
                    Try again
                </button>
            </body>
        </html>
    )
}
```

The global error handling file will handle root layout errors and act as a catch-all for app errors

Time to save, commit, and sync

Congratulations 🎉 you now have error handling and logging for pages as well as global error handling in your project
