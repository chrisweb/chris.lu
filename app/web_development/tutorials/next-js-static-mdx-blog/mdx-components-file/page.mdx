# The mdx-components file

Before we experiment with plugins in the next chapter, I wanted to first come back to the `mdx-components.tsx` file, which we briefly saw when setting up MDX support (at the very beginning), as the file is required to make MDX work

`mdx-components.tsx` is great for quickly and easily replacing an HTML Element with a React component

For example, how can we quickly add a CSS class to all our `<ul>` [unordered list elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) because the markdown syntax does NOT let us add a class in a similar way to how we add a class to an HTML element the ul is not even part of the markdown syntax:

```md
* foo
* bar
```

To solve this, you could add a remark plugin, which would extend the base markdown syntax, but if you want to move your content to another platform someday, then that platform might not understand your custom markdown syntax as the plugin you used to add classes to lists is not installed

You could also write a custom react component, but then you would need to manually import and use that react component in every single MDX page. The advantage of using the **mdx-components** file is that you only need to import a component once. For example, in an upcoming chapter, we will create a custom link component. We will only need to import it once into the **mdx-components** file, but it will still transform every link in every page of our project .

This is why the solution we will use is the next/mdx `mdx-components.tsx` file, and as we will see in the next chapter, it will allow us to add a class to all of our lists without using an extra plugin, and without having to introduce any new markdown syntax

## Adding a CSS class to lists using mdx-components

First, open the `mdx-components.tsx` (which is in the root of your project) and add an entry for each headline, like so:

```tsx title="mdx-components.tsx" showLineNumbers {12-16}
import type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'

// This file allows you to provide custom React components
// to be used in MDX files. You can import and use any
// React component you want, including components from
// other libraries.

// This file is required to use MDX in `app` directory.
export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
    return {
        // Allows customizing built-in components, e.g. to add styling.
        ul: ({ children, ...props }) => (
            <ul className="listContainer" {...props}>
                {children}
            </ul>
        ),
        ...components,
    }
}
```

Lines 12 to 16: we have created a simple custom component for **ul lists**, what happens is that first, the markdown parser turns the markdown list into HTML, and then mdx-components will be used to add a CSS class called `listContainer` to each `<ul>` element

## CSS class example using a MDX playground page

Next, let's create a new playground to experiment with the **mdx-components** file

Inside the `/app/tutorial_examples` folder, create a `mdx-components_playground` folder

Then, in the `mdx-components_playground` folder, create a `page.mdx` file and paste the following content into it:

```mdx title="/app/tutorial_examples/mdx-components_playground/page.mdx"
<article>

* foo
* bar

</article>

```

> [!NOTE]  
> We wrap our content with the `article` HTML element so that the content is not placed directly into the `main` HTML element (of our layout), which has a **flex-direction** set to **row**, the `article` element has a flex-direction of **column** (we defined all this in our `global.css` file which is in the `app` folder when we created it)  

Now ensure the dev server is running (or launch it using the `npm run dev` command), and then in the browser, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/tutorial_examples/mdx-components_playground](http://localhost:3000/tutorial_examples/mdx-components_playground), then use your browser developer tools inspect tool and you will see that the `<ul>` element now has a **class** attribute containing the value `listContainer`

Congratulations üéâ you just learned how to use the **mdx-components** file, in other parts of this tutorial, we will edit this file again and add several more features to it
