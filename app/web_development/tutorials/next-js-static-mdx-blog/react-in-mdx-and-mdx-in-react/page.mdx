# React in MDX and MDX in react

You can add React components inside of MDX content but the other way around works too, meaning we will explore a bit how to use MDX in components and typescript pages

## React components in MDX content

Of course the big advantage of MDX over regular markdown is that we use any React component inside of our MDX content

First create a new folder `components` in the root of your project

Inside of the `components` folder create a `tutorial_examples` folder and inside of that folder another `buttons` folder

Now inside of the `buttons` folder create a `Counting.tsx` file and insert the following code:

```tsx title="/components/tutorial_examples/buttons/Counting.tsx"
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

const Counting: React.FC = () => {

    const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

    const handleClick = () => {
        setCount(count + 1)
    }

    return (
        <>
            <button onClick={handleClick}>
                Clicked {count} times
            </button>
        </>
    )
}

export default Counting
```

Now lets edit the `/app/tutorial_examples/first_mdx_page/page.mdx` page we created earlier and add our Counting component to it, like so:

```mdx title="/app/tutorial_examples/first_mdx_page/page.mdx"
import Counting from '@/components/tutorial_examples/buttons/Counting'

# Hello ðŸ‘‹ with MDX!

<Counting />

```

> [!NOTE]  
> did you notice how we did NOT use the relative path that would be '../components/tutorial_examples/buttons/Counting', but instead we used the **@/** alias which we added when creating the project (using creat-next-app), the advantage of using the alias is that no matter where we move our page the path to the Button will always stay the same (of course if we move the button then we also need to update the import(s))

Make sure your dev server is running, if it is not start it using `npm run dev`

And then visit the updated MDX page in the browser at `http://localhost:3000/first_page` and try out the counting button

Of course this is just an example, you can import any component you want, for example a chart component to visualize some statistics or a component displaying a 3d model of an object and so on

## MDX in pages and components

Besides turning a whole page into an MDX page as we saw in the previous chapter, you can also import MDX into typescript pages and components

### import MDX content into a typescript page

First inside of the `/app/tutorial_examples` folder create a new `mdx_in_a_page` folder

Then in the `mdx_in_a_page` folder create a file called `content.mdx` with the following content:

```md title="/app/tutorial_examples/mdx_in_a_page/content.mdx"
# Hello ðŸ‘‹ World!

I'm MDX content that got imported in a regular page.tsx file
```

And then in the same folder create a `page.tsx` with the following content:

```tsx title="/app/tutorial_examples/mdx_in_a_page/page.tsx"
import ContentMDX from './content.mdx'

export default function Page() {

    return (
        <>
            <ContentMDX />
        </>
    )
}
```

Make sure your dev server is running, if it is not start it using `npm run dev`

And then visit your newly created page in the browser at `http://localhost:3000/tutorial_examples/mdx_in_a_page`

### import MDX into a component

First go into the `/components/tutorial_examples` folder and then create another folder called `mdx`

Inside of the `mdx` folder create a `content.mdx` file and insert the following content:

```md title="/components/tutorial_examples/mdx/content.mdx"
# Hello ðŸ‘‹ World!

I'm MDX content that got imported in a Component
```

And then in the same folder create a `Example.tsx` file, with the following content:

```tsx title="/components/tutorial_examples/mdx/Example.tsx"
import ContentMDX from './content.mdx'

const MDXExample: React.FC = () => {

    return (
        <>
            <ContentMDX />
        </>
    )
}

export default MDXExample
```

Then inside of `/app/tutorial_examples` folder, create another new folder `mdx_in_a_component` and finally in that folder create a page file `page.tsx` with the following content:

```tsx title="/app/tutorial_examples/mdx_in_a_component/page.tsx"
import MDXExample from '@/components/tutorial_examples/mdx/Example'

export default function Page() {

    return (
        <>
            <MDXExample />
        </>
    )
}
```

Make sure your dev server is running, if it is not start it using `npm run dev`

And then visit your newly created MDX page in the browser at `http://localhost:3000/tutorial_examples/mdx_in_a_component`
