# Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights

We are now going to add Vercel **Analytics** and **Speed Insights** to our Next.js 15 project using 2 packages by Vercel so that later we can go to our Vercel Dashboard and check out how well our project performs

The 2 chapters are quite similar because both packages work similarly. The real difference is only the name. This means that if you are done with the Analytics chapter, you just need to repeat the same steps for the Speed Insights package.

## Add Vercel Analytics to your project

> [!WARN]  
> If you want to use this service, extra fees might apply, so make sure you check out the [vercel analytics pricing page](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/limits-and-pricing) first; on a hobby plan the first 2500 events are free, and data will be kept for up to one month

As we are about to release our project, now should be a good time to add [vercel analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/quickstart) so that we can have an overview of who visits our project

First, go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and log in

You should now be on the overview page, select the project for which you want to add analytics

On the project page, in the top navigation click on **Analytics**

Next, click on the **Enable** button

Chose your plan, if you haven't already done so you may want to check out the [Vercel analytics pricing page](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/limits-and-pricing)

Now we need to add Vercel Analytics to our Next.js project, so we go back into VSCode and open our project

Then we open the VSCode terminal and run the following command to install the Vercel Analytics package:

```shell title="terminal" showLineNumbers
npm i @vercel/analytics --save-exact
```

Now we open the **root layout** that is the `/app` folder, and add the following code:

```tsx title="/app/layout.tsx" showLineNumbers {5} {43}
import './global.css'
import { Metadata } from 'next'
import HeaderNavigation from '@/components/header/Navigation'
import { Kablammo } from 'next/font/google'
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: {
        template: '%s | example.com',
        default: 'Home | example.com',
    },
    description: 'My description',
    openGraph: {
        url: 'https://example.com/',
        siteName: 'My website name',
        locale: 'en_US',
        type: 'website',
    },
}

const kablammo = Kablammo({
    subsets: ['latin'],
    variable: '--font-kablammo',
    weight: ['400'],
    display: 'swap',
})

export default function RootLayout({
    children,
}: {
    children: React.ReactNode
}) {
    return (
        <html lang="en" className={kablammo.variable}>
            <body>
                <header>
                    <HeaderNavigation />
                </header>
                <main>{children}</main>
                <footer>
                    <p>My Footer</p>
                </footer>
                <Analytics />
            </body>
        </html>
    )
}
```

Line 5: we import the react component from the Vercel [Analytics](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/analytics) package

Line 43: we add the **Analytics react component** right before the body closing tag

There are a few things you can configure, like for example, the debug mode is enabled by default and will print messages in your console when the environment is development, to disable it change the code to this:

```tsx title="/app/layout.tsx" showLineNumbers{43}
<Analytics debug={false} />
```

Line 43 set the **debug** prop of the analytics component to **false** to disable the debug mode

There is also a **beforeSend** option that lets you modify the events before they get sent to Vercel, if you want to use this [advanced option](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/package), I recommend you have a look at their [official example](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/package) in the Vercel Analytics documentation

To see your **Analytics** in action, log in to your Vercel account, click on your project name, and then click on **Analytics**

## Add Vercel Speed Insights to your project

> [!WARN]  
> If you want to use this service, extra fees might apply, so make sure you check out the [Vercel Speed Insights pricing page](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/limits-and-pricing) first; on a hobby plan, the first project is free, and you get up 10k free analytics events

First, go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and log in

You should now be on the overview page, select the project for which you want to add analytics

On the project page, in the top navigation click on **Speed Insights**

Next, click on the **Enable** button

```shell title="terminal"

```

Now we open the root layout that is the `/app` folder, and add the following code:

```tsx title="/app/layout.tsx" showLineNumbers {6} {45}
import './global.css'
import { Metadata } from 'next'
import HeaderNavigation from '@/components/header/Navigation'
import { Kablammo } from 'next/font/google'
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: {
        template: '%s | example.com',
        default: 'Home | example.com',
    },
    description: 'My description',
    openGraph: {
        url: 'https://example.com/',
        siteName: 'My website name',
        locale: 'en_US',
        type: 'website',
    },
}

const kablammo = Kablammo({
    subsets: ['latin'],
    variable: '--font-kablammo',
    weight: ['400'],
    display: 'swap',
})

export default function RootLayout({
    children,
}: {
    children: React.ReactNode
}) {
    return (
        <html lang="en" className={kablammo.variable}>
            <body>
                <header>
                    <HeaderNavigation />
                </header>
                <main>{children}</main>
                <footer>
                    <p>My Footer</p>
                </footer>
                <Analytics />
                <SpeedInsights />
            </body>
        </html>
    )
}
```

## How to fix TrustedScript errors

If the CSP **trusted-types** directive is in use, then you will get the following errors in your browser console:

```shell
This document requires 'TrustedScriptURL' assignment.
```

Which is why you need to remove the directive from your CSP header, to do so edit your `next.config.mjs` file and then search for `require-trusted-types-for` and delete that entry from your CSP directives list

You might want to add a comment instead (above the defaultCSPDirectives) to let other developers that might wonder why this directive is missing, or why you haven't included it:

```js
// we commented out the trusted types directive:
// require-trusted-types-for 'script';
// because of the following error in the browser console:
// This document requires 'TrustedScript' assignment
```

I have more details about this directive in the [require-trusted-types-for](/web_development/posts/csp#require-trusted-types-for-directive) chapter in the CSP post

A second change you need to do (when using Vercel analytics), is to add the `https://va.vercel-scripts.com` domain for the **development** environment to the **script-src** directive:

```shell
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://va.vercel-scripts.com;
```

This is only needed in development, in development Vercel Analytics does NOT track visits, but it is still loading a script from that domain, which is why we add it to the script-src directive
