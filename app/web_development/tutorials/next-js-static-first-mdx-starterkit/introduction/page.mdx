# Introduction

Static first means that we first create a static base, where we use static site generation (SSG) to generate our pages at **build time**, to hopefully minimize Server Side Rendering (SSR) at **run time**. If parts of your pages get prerendered at built time (when deploying), will lead to faster loading of your pages and decrease the load on your servers. Beyond this tutorial, when the static part is done you will be able to use Next.js 15 features like **PPR** (experimental) and **component streaming** (using React 19 suspend) to add in dynamic parts.

Our secondary goal focuses on adding MDX support to a Next.js 15 project (as well as several related features) because MDX pages can be great to create a **developer portfolio**, a **documentation website**, a **blog** and a lot more.

This tutorial is based on my experience building chris.lu (the source code can be found in my [chris.lu repository](https://github.com/chrisweb/chris.lu)). So hopefully after reading this tutorial you will be able to get a great lighthouse score, too:

> [!NOTE]  
> I tried to make this tutorial as **beginner-friendly** as possible, but also complete enough to be helpful for **senior developers**. This version of the tutorial uses Next.js 15, React 19, and ESLint 9, if you need a Next.js 14 version of this tutorial visit ["Next.js 14 static mdx blog" tutorial](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-mdx-blog).

## Preview

In this tutorial, we will:

* create a "static first" project using the Next.js v15.x app directory
* create several components using React v19.x (optimized using React compiler)
* add support for MDX content formatting via the @next/mdx package
* Add linting for both code and content (using ESLint MDX and ESLint v9 flat config)
* add MDX plugins to generate a table of contents, code block syntax highlighting (using your favorite VSCode theme), as well as support for GitHub flavored markdown and GitHub like alerts
* add a CI/CD pipeline using Vercel.com so that every time we commit code to our GitHub repository, it gets automatically deployed (staging/production)
* add bugs monitoring and Content Security Policy (CSP) violations logging using Sentry.io
* install useful extensions for VSCode and learn how to use them

> [!NOTE]  
> I made this tutorial with total beginners in mind. However, if you are already an experienced Next.js dev, then there are some chapters you may want to skip

## Technology stack

* Backend framework: **Next.js 15.x**
* Frontend framework: **React 19.x** (with React compiler support)
* Linting: **ESLint 9.x** (flat config)
* MDX support: **@next/mdx 15.x**
