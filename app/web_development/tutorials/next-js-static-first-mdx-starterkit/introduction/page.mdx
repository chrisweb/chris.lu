# Introduction

The tutorial is about adding **MDX support** to a **Next.js 15** (and **React 19**) project because MDX pages can be great to create a **developer portfolio**, a **documentation website**, a **blog** and a lot more. To achieve this we will add several features through **MDX (remark / rehype) plugins**, like **code highlighting**, automatic **table of contents** generation, **github flavored markdown** and **alerts**, **frontmatter**, and a few more. But the tutorial goes beyond adding MDX support, as it contains several chapters about, improving security (for example by adding a **content security policy (CSP)** header), speed optimizations that will **improve** your **web vital metrics**. 

The tutorial is also about creating a solid **static first** core, where we use static site generation (SSG) to generate our pages at **build time**, to avoid Server Side Rendering (SSR) at **run time** as much as possible. Pre-rendering (parts of) your pages at built time (when deploying), will minimize the amount of SSR and lead to decreased loading times as well as decreased load on your servers. Beyond this tutorial, I recommend looking into Next.js 15 features like **Partial Pre-rendering (PPR)** (experimental) and **component streaming** (in Next.js 15 using React 19 suspend) to add in dynamic parts, but also **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**.

We will also make sure the project includes features that hopefully increase your (our teams) **developer experience (DX)**, like using the **Typescript** (VSCode autocomplete, type information), by setting up linting support using **ESLint v9** and **flat config** files (with no RC compatibility mode), by adding **extensions** to **VSCode** to improve linting while you code or write markdown (in MDX files). We will use Vercel for our deployment (CI/CD and hosting) needs (feel to replace that part with a deployment on GitHub pages (setting Next.js "output" configuration option to "export") or you could self host your project (Next.js 15 comes with some improvements for self hosting). We will also add **error logging** and **CSP violations logging** using Sentry.io (again if you prefer to use another service, you can swap that part out and use your preferred solution instead).

> [!NOTE]  
> I tried to make this tutorial as **beginner-friendly** as possible, but also complete enough to be helpful for **senior developers**

This tutorial is partially based on my experience building chris.lu (the source code of my blog be found in my [chris.lu repository](https://github.com/chrisweb/chris.lu) on GitHub). I mention this because it allowed me to test the performance in production (with real visitors from all around the world). So hopefully after reading this tutorial you will be able to build your own and get a great lighthouse score, too:

Any contributions are always welcome ðŸ™‚. If you have a question feel free to ask on the <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faComments} size="1x" color='rgb(255, 0, 170)' /> [discussion](https://github.com/chrisweb/chris.lu/discussions) page and if you find a bug please report it using the <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBug} size="1x" color='rgb(255, 0, 170)' /> [issues](https://github.com/chrisweb/chris.lu/issues) (PRs for any open Issue are welcome too, if unsure about your PR, ask in the ticket first).

## Source code

All the source code for this tutorial can be found in the [next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit_tutorial_chris.lu](https://github.com/chrisweb/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit_tutorial_chris.lu) repository on GitHub, every chapter of this tutorial is a separate branch in the repository (over time I will probably not keep each branch updated, but I will try to keep the main branch updated for a while and of course PRs are welcome ðŸ˜‰).

## If you are migrating to Next.js 15 and React 19

After transitioning from the pages router to the app router in Next.js 14, yes we are now back at updating the core of our project, but hey look at all the goodies we get ðŸ¤©.

> [!TIP]  
> If you plan on migrating from Next.js 14 (or even 12/13), then I suggest to split the work it into two steps, first step update your project dependencies as well as the Next.js packages to their latest versions and then fix the problems that arose due to breaking changes in some of these packages. Same for the transition of React 18 to React 19, it might also take some time. Like converting converting components using forwardRef to components using the ref that is now in component props, so don't forget to have a look at the [react-codemods repository on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod) as those might save you a lot of time
>  
> Then in a second step you can start also adding support for new Next.js 15 (and React 19) features into your codebase. Like using Turbopack in dev, or convert the next.config to a typescript file or as we will do in an upcoming chapter transition your classic ESLInt configuration to a flat config

Getting your project back to building without errors will already take some time. Depending on the size of your project the changes related to [new caching semantics](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15#caching-semantics), or Cookies and SearchParams now being async functions (but there is a [Next.js codemod](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods) to help with that)

I have a separate post with more details about what has changed on [The road to Next.js 15 and React 19](/web_development/posts/road-to-react-19-next-js-15).

## Some Next.js 15 (Turbopack) features are NOT stable yet

There are a few features that I could NOT use in this tutorial or had to disable and I wanted you to be aware of it before we start with the actual tutorial

* Converting the **next.config.js** file to a next.config.ts file: as I describe in the upcoming "Next.js 15 config" page there is [NO support for ESM only packages](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/next-config#nextconfigts-does-not-yet-support-esm) (but it is coming)
* Using **Turbopack** in development: as we will see in a future chapter does NOT always work (don't get me wrong, I love Turbopack and plan on using it fully as soon as possible, but I also feel like we need to give Turbopack a bit more time to mature), one such case where Turbopack will fail is when [you also intend to enable typed routes](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/typescript-plugin-and-typed-routes#turbopack-in-nextjs-15-does-not-yet-support-typed-routes), we will see another case when we start working on logging errors, we will use the Sentry SDK for Next.js, which works only without Turbopack as the [Sentry SDK is NOT compatible with Turbopack](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/error-handling-and-logging#sentry-does-not-yet-support-turbopack) (just yet), then in Next.js v15.0 Turbopack has NO SUPPORT for MDX (remark / rehype) plugins, in Next.js v15.1 they just added a new **experimental** loader ðŸŽ‰ that allows you to use MDX plugins written in Javascript with Turbopack (which is written in Rust), more about this in the upcoming [MDX plugins page]()
* Support for ESLint **flat config** files: yes in Next.js there is support for ESLint 9, but as we will see [Not everything has full ESLint v9 & flat config support / compatibility](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/linting-setup-using-eslint#not-everything-is-eslint-v9-and-flat-config-yet), ~~CNA v15.0 for example still installs ESLint v8~~ since CNA (Next.js) v5.1 it now installs ESLint v9, it now installs ESLint v9), so now everything is ESLint v9 compatible, but both Next.js ESLint packages still use classic configuration files (RC) and NOT flat config
* There are also features like **PPR** (which we will not use it in this tutorial) that work already well today but they are **NOT** marked as stable (yet).

## Next.js 14 version of this tutorial

If you don't plan on migrating just yet and still use Next.js 14 then know that I also have a [Next.js 14 version of this tutorial](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-mdx-blog) (covering the same topics but also some differences in the content due to the changes that happened between Next.js 14 and Next.js 15)

Of course we will use a lot more packages than this, you can find a full list in the package.json (as well as the whole source code of this tutorial) in the ["Next.js 15 static first MDX starterkit" GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrisweb/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit_tutorial_chris.lu)
