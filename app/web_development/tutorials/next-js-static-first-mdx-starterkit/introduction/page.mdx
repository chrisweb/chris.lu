# Introduction

I tried to make this tutorial as beginner-friendly as possible, but also complete enough to be helpful for senior developers. If you have a question feel free to ask on the <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faComments} size="1x" color='rgb(255, 0, 170)' /> [discussion](https://github.com/chrisweb/chris.lu/discussions) page and if you find a bug please report it using the <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBug} size="1x" color='rgb(255, 0, 170)' /> [issues](https://github.com/chrisweb/chris.lu/issues).

The main goal of this tutorial is to build a blazingly fast Next.js 15 project that is static first. Static first does NOT mean you can't add dynamic parts after finishing this tutorial. Static first means we first create a base, where we use static site generation ([SSG](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation)) to generate our pages, meaning no SSR / no work is done at runtime, all the work is done at built time (when deploying). We will add CSP headers to make sure our app is secure, we will use Next.js features like next/image and next/font to further improve the loading times of our pages.

A secondary goal is to create a project that has a low maintenance core and a great developer experience (DX) so that we can add new features quickly in the future (instead of having to do maintenance work). We will achieve great DX by using Typescript (which gives us type safety and code autocomplete in VSCode through Intelisense) and by using VSCode and several extensions. We will use services like Vercel to automate our deployments (saving us time) and Sentry to log errors (helping us track and understand errors). We will also improve the DX by adding linting for both code and content using a custom ESLint 9 (flat config).

This tutorial is based on my experience building chris.lu, and hopefully it will help you build your own dream project. After reading this tutorial you should be able to get great lighthouse scores. For example, here is a screenshot of the lighthouse score for the homepage of this blog:

## Preview

In this tutorial, we will:

* create a "static first" project using the Next.js v15.x app directory
* create several components using React v19.x (optimized using React compiler)
* add support for MDX content formatting via the @next/mdx package
* Add linting for both code and content (using ESLint MDX and ESLint v9 flat config)
* add MDX plugins to generate a table of contents, code block syntax highlighting (using your favorite VSCode theme), as well as support for GitHub flavored markdown and GitHub like alerts
* add a CI/CD pipeline using Vercel.com so that every time we commit code to our GitHub repository, it gets automatically deployed (staging/production)
* add bugs monitoring and Content Security Policy (CSP) violations logging using Sentry.io
* install useful extensions for VSCode and learn how to use them

> [!NOTE]  
> I made this tutorial with total beginners in mind. However, if you are already an experienced Next.js dev, then there are some chapters you may want to skip

## Technology stack

> [!NOTE]  
> There is a previous version of this tutorial, that uses Next.js 14.x (and is compatible with Next.js 13). So if you are not (yet) using the latest Next.js 15 then you might want to check out the [Next.js 14 static mdx blog](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-mdx-blog) tutorial instead

* backend framework: Next.js 15.x
* frontend framework: React 19.x (with React compiler support)
* MDX support: @next/mdx 15.x
* linting: ESLint 9.x
