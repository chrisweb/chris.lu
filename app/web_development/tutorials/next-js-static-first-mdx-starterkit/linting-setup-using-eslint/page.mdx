# Next.js 15 and ESLint v9 linting setup 

Adding linting to a project is something I recommend doing as early as possible, similar to adding CSP to a project

Those are things that, if you postpone them, then you will have a lot more work later, which is why it is best to add linting as early as possible and then fix linting-related problems one by one as soon as they come up

> [!NOTE]
> the 5 upcoming chapters only contain background information, if you prefer you can also go straight to coding part in the ["ESLint 9 flat config for Next.js 15" chapter](#eslint-9-flat-config-for-nextjs-15)

## Linting library choice

If you would prefer an alternative linting solution, I recommend checking out [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/), they have an interesting [playground](https://biomejs.dev/playground/) to learn more about biome (compared to Prettier), they also have a very good documentation, for example I like that their [Getting Started](https://biomejs.dev/guides/getting-started/) page will show you the commands for npm, yarn, pnpm, bun and deno

## The state of ESLint v9 and flat config

ESLint mentions in their documentation:

> We are transitioning to a new config system in ESLint v9.0.0. The config system shared on this page is currently the default but will be deprecated in v9.0.0. You can opt-in to the new config system by following the instructions in the documentation.

You can still use **eslintrc** (classic) configuration files but it is recommended that you switch to the new [flat config files](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files)

Most projects have added support for ESLint v9:

* For example the plugin [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/eslint-plugin-react-hooks%405.0.0) introduced support for ESLint v9 on Oct. 11 2024 (in eslint-plugin-react-hooks v5.0.0); this is one of the plugins Next.js was waiting for
* Another plugin that you see in a lot of projects is typescript-eslint, in May 13 2024 they announced in their [typescript-eslint Issue #8211](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8211) that the first alpha of [typescript-eslint v8 (with ESLint v9 support)](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/9002) got merged

If you are interested in the progress of more packages and plugins, then have a look at the Issue in the ESLint repository that keeps track of the [flat config rollout](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18093)

> [!MORE]

> [ESLint "flag config part 2" blog post](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/new-config-system-part-2/)  
> [ESLint "flag config part 3" blog post](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/new-config-system-part-3/)  
> [ESLint "flat config files" RFC](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/tree/main/designs/2019-config-simplification)  

## Next.js 15 ESLint v9 update

In ESLint v9 the eslintrc files are **deprecated**, support for [**eslintrc** (classic) configuration files will be removed in ESLint version 10.0.0](https://eslint.org/blog/2023/10/flat-config-rollout-plans/#eslintrc-removed-in-eslint-v10.0.0)

The [next 15 blog post](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15#eslint-9-support) mentioned that:

* you can now use ESLint v9 (or continue using v8)
* if Next.js detects that you are still using ESLint v8 they automatically set the `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=false` flag, which [enables support for flat config files in ESLint v8](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide#start-using-flat-config-files)

Most of that work happened in the [PR #71218](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/71218/files)

### Not everything is ESLint v9 and flat config (yet)

If you use the latest **create-next-app** (CNA) it will NOT install ESLint v9, instead CNA sets ESLint to ^8 (in the package.json) which means npm will attempt to install v8.57.1 and doing so will trigger a npm warn deprecated message:

```shell
eslint@8.57.1: This version is no longer supported. Please see https://eslint.org/version-support for other options.
```

If you use npm run lint (next lint cli) and have no eslint configuration file, then next lint will install ESLint v9

No matter if you have used the CNA or next lint, both still create eslintrc files and NOT flat config files, so yes Next.js has updated their packages to support ESLint v9 but they have NOT yet updated their packages to support [shareable flat config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/shareable-configs) files

Both CNA and next lint installed the latest [eslint-config-next](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/eslint-config-next), however the latest **eslint-config-next** is not compatible with flat config files, as we will see in one of the upcoming chapters, which does NOT mean you can NOT use eslint-config-next with flat configs, but it means that if you do you will need to add a compatibility layer for it wo work (which is what we will do in one of the upcoming chapters)

## Why does Next.js have two packages related to ESLINT?

Next.js has **2 packages** that are related to ESLint, one is called eslint-**config**-next (ESLint Config), and the other one is called eslint-**plugin**-next (ESLint Plugin)

* [eslint-config-next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-next)
* [eslint-plugin-next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/eslint-plugin-next)

Package 1: **eslint-config-next** (ESLint Config) intends to make it easier to get started with ESLint by installing and configuring several plugins for us, some of these plugins are:

* [eslint-plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react)
* [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)
* [eslint-plugin-next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/eslint-plugin-next)
* and some more, if you want the full list of plugins that eslint-config-next installs, check out the [eslint-config-next package.json dependencies](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/b2625477c002343e7fe083204c45af1fdd7cd407/packages/eslint-config-next/package.json)

Package 2: **eslint-plugin-next** is the actual ESLint plugin for Nextjs (called **@next/eslint-plugin-next** on npmjs), it aims to catch common problems in a Next.js application

For a complete list of rules that the Next.js ESLint plugin adds check out the [Nextjs "ESLint rules" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint#eslint-plugin) or have a look at the [eslint-plugin-next rules directory on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/eslint-plugin-next/src/rules)

> [Next.js "ESLint" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint)  

## ESLint 9 flat config for Next.js 15

First we are going to make sure we have the latest ESLint v9.x version installed by using the following command:

```shell
npm i eslint@latest --save-dev --save-exact
```

In the [Project setup and Next.js 15 installation](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/project-setup-using-CNA-and-first-commit) chapter we used **create-next-app** (CNA) which created an .eslintrc.json, which is a **classic** ESLint configuration file, in this chapter we want to convert that **classic** configuration file into a [**flat config** file](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files)

At this point we can check out the [ESLint "Migrate Your Config File" documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide) which tells us to use the [ESLint Configuration Migrator](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/05/eslint-configuration-migrator/) which is tool to help us convert eslintrc configuration files to Flat Config files

Our eslintrc file currently looks like this:

```json title=".eslintrc.json"
{
    "extends": [
        "next/core-web-vitals",
        "next/typescript"
    ]
}
```

To convert it we launch the ESLint Configuration Migrator, using the following command (depending on what extension you use for your eslintrc, if you do NOT use json then you need to adjust the file name in the command):

```shell
npx @eslint/migrate-config .eslintrc.json
```

The configuration migrator will convert your `.eslintrc.json` classic configuration file into an `eslint.config.mjs` flat config file

At the end of the update the configuration migrator will display a message, in which it recommends to now install the following dependencies, we follow through by executing the following command:

```shell
npm install @eslint/js@latest @eslint/eslintrc@latest --save-dev --save-exact
```

The 2 dependencies we just installed are needed by the `eslint.config.mjs` file, as it will import and use code from both packages (**@eslint/js** and **@eslint/eslintrc**). The ESLint **js** package is the ESLint JavaScript Plugin and contains everything we need to parse Javascript, **eslintrc** adds a compatibility layer for packages that still use the classic configuration (eslintrc) format

Now that we have converted our classic configuration to a flat configuration, let's open the `eslint.config.mjs` file and have a look at what is inside:

```js title="eslint.config.mjs"
import path from "node:path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";
import js from "@eslint/js";
import { FlatCompat } from "@eslint/eslintrc";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
const compat = new FlatCompat({
    baseDirectory: __dirname,
    recommendedConfig: js.configs.recommended,
    allConfig: js.configs.all
});
export default [...compat.extends("next/core-web-vitals", "next/typescript")];
```

We can see that the extends that was in our `.eslintrc.json` file got converted into the extends from the compatibility layer (which it has created using the `FlatCompat` class from the `@eslint/eslintrc` package)

> [!TIP]  
> If you are not creating a new project from scratch but instead have to upgrade a legacy ESLint setup, then I recommend checking out the [ESLint Compatibility Utilities](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/05/eslint-compatibility-utilities/) blog post from May 2024, it has some details about yet another package which has tools that can fix problems common problems that arise when using legacy rules and configurations

One last thing, the migration script has NOT deleted our original eslintrc file, so I recommend deleting the `.eslintrc.json` (in the root of the project) manually, we won't need it anymore

At this point you have a working ESLint setup using ESLint v9 and flat config files, you can use the following command to try it out:

```shell
npm run lint
```

### Typescript ESLint configuration files

As we converted our **next.config** file to a (`next.config.ts`) typescript file, to be consistent we will also convert our **eslint.config** to an `eslint.config.ts` file (but if you prefer not to and want to keep the eslint.config.mjs as is, then feel free to skip to the [ignores and linter options](#ignore-folders-and-setting-linter-options) chapter)

First we rename our ESlint configuration file to `eslint.config.ts` (you can also use `eslint.config.mts` or `eslint.config.cts` if you prefer), in this tutorial I will use **eslint.config.ts** (to match how we named the **next.config.ts** file)

Next we need to install additional [@types/eslint__eslintrc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/eslint__eslintrc) types for the [@eslint/eslintrc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eslint/eslintrc) package:

```shell
npm i @types/eslint__eslintrc@latest --save-dev --save-exact
```

Then we need to add the [jiti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jiti) dependency (when using Node.js, Deno and Bun users don't need it) which is required to read typescript configuration files:

```shell
npm i jiti@latest --save-dev --save-exact
```

> [!MORE]  
> [ESLint "typescript configuration files" documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#typescript-configuration-files)  

#### Add types to the ESLint configuration file

We edit the `eslint.config.ts` file and make the following few changes:

```ts title="eslint.config.ts" showLineNumbers {5}
import path from 'node:path'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url'
import js from '@eslint/js'
import { FlatCompat } from '@eslint/eslintrc'
import type { Linter } from 'eslint'

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename)
const compat = new FlatCompat({
    baseDirectory: __dirname,
    recommendedConfig: js.configs.recommended,
    allConfig: js.configs.all
})

export default [
    ...compat.extends('next/core-web-vitals', 'next/typescript'),
] satisfies Linter.Config[]
```

Line 5: we import the ESLint **Linter** type

Line X: we use the [satisfies operator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-9.html#the-satisfies-operator) (that got introduced in TypeScript 4.9) to tell Typescript that our default export will be an array of **Linter.Config**, each **ESLint Linter Config** contains information about which files should get included or ignored, custom rules configurations, you can give it a name and some more which we will see more in detail in the upcoming chapters

> [!NOTE]  
> Because we added the types for `@eslint/eslintrc` package in the previous chapter we now have a typed FlatCompat (in case you want to check out what other options are available)  

#### Replacing next lint with eslint

The typescript eslint configuration files are not supported by the Next.js 15.x lint cli (as of now), the file gets mentioned in the [Next.js **runLintCheck** code](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/c3bc7d05983d3c5604d4532ceb706d5973aef642/packages/next/src/lib/eslint/runLintCheck.ts#L366) but there is no implementation (yet)

If you have converted your ESLint configuration to an `eslint.config.ts` file and use the linting command `npm run lint` then `next lint` will not find our configuration file, and instead starts the wizard (which is supposed to guide us through setting up a new ESLint classic configuration)

As we can't use next lint we need to create our own linting command:

* as we can NOT use **next lint**, we will use the **eslint cli** instead
* we will also enable the [(experimental) typescript support](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#typescript-configuration-files) for ESLint Flat Config files by adding an extra flag to our command (typescript support for configuration files is a feature that got added in [ESLint v9.9.0](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/08/eslint-v9.9.0-released/#experimental-typescript-configuration-files))
* finally we will enable caching (as would next lint do) and we set the cache folder path to the same folder that Next.js uses

```shell
npx eslint --flag unstable_ts_config --cache --cache-location .next/cache/eslint/
```

Now that we have created a new command we can update our package.json (in the root of the project) to update our linting script(s):

```json title="package.json" {6}
"scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "dev-turbo": "next dev --turbopack",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "eslint --flag unstable_ts_config --cache --cache-location .next/cache/eslint/"
},
```

There is one more problem left, the **next build** script uses **next lint** by default, which will check if we have a Javascript eslint.config, but as we switched to a Typescript eslint file (which next lint does NOT yet support), we need to add our custom linting command to build script (we use the nocache version of our linting command, feel free to use the one with cache if that works better for your use case):

```json title="package.json" {4}
"scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev --turbopack",
    "dev-turbo": "next dev --turbopack",
    "build": "npm run lint-nocache && next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "eslint --flag unstable_ts_config --cache --cache-location .next/cache/eslint/"
},
```

And now that we have updated the build script to use our custom linting command, we need to edit the Next.js configuration file and tell Next.js to NOT do its own linting during builds:

```ts title="next.config.ts" showLineNumbers{43}
eslint: {
    // we have added a lint command to the package.json build script
    // which is why we disable the default next lint (during builds) here
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
},
```

> [!MORE]  
> [Next.js "ignoreDuringBuilds" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/eslint)  

### Adding even more scripts

We could add more scripts related to linting, for example here we add a backup of the command that Next.js used, we also add a command without the use of a cache, the last two use different flags (to debug ESLint configurations and fix problems automatically)

First we update our `package.json` file (in the root) and add the following scripts:

```json title="package.json" {4-8}
"scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev --turbopack",
    "dev-turbo": "next dev --turbopack",
    "build": "npm run lint-nocache && next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "next-lint": "next lint",
    "lint": "eslint --flag unstable_ts_config --cache --cache-location .next/cache/eslint/",
    "lint-nocache": "eslint --flag unstable_ts_config",
    "lint-fix": "eslint --flag unstable_ts_config --fix"
},
```

Then if you want you could update the README with these explanations:

```md title="README.md"
`npm run next-lint`: a backup of the original next.js linting command
`npm run lint`: to manually use our (custom) linting command, it will scan our code and help us find problems in it (gets used by the build command before building)
`npm run lint-nocache`: same as **lint** command without cache, takes longer but can be useful when testing changes
`npm run lint-fix`: the **lint** command with the **fix** flag activated (to automatically fix errors and warnings if it can), you probably want to create a new branch before running this as it might produce a big quantity of changed files
```

## ESLint debugging tools

Here are 3 tools I found while working on this ESLint tutorial (I wish I had found earlier 😉) that will improve your ESLint debugging experience greatly

Our first 2 tools are cli commands:

```shell
npx eslint --debug eslint.config.ts
```

This is a fantastic tool (cli command) that will output a lot of information that could help you while debugging, run the same command without a path to your configuration file and it will show you even more debugging information by performing a very very verbose output of the entire linting process (if you don't use a typescript eslint flat config then you need to adjust the name, for example to `npx eslint --debug eslint.config.mjs` for a javascript flat config)

```shell
npx eslint --print-config eslint.config.ts
```

Another cli command that will print a json representation of what it found in your configuration file, which is a great tool to verify if everything you have set up is included

The third tool is the one that helped me the most while writing this guide, this tool greatly improves the **(developer experience) DX** when working with the new flat config files by helping you visualize the structure and content of your eslint flat config:

```shell
npx eslint --inspect-config eslint.config.ts
```

After running the command, the **ESLint Config Inspector** will launch a server on `http://localhost:7777/` (it should automatically use your default browser)

The main page displays a nice overview of your files, ignores, options, plugins and rules, for each of your configurations

On this overview page you see why it is a good idea to give your configurations a name 😉

Each configuration (row) is a disclosure widget, expand it and it will show you even more information about each of your configurations

If you want you can add those commands to your package json scripts:

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
    "lint-debug-config": "eslint --flag unstable_ts_config --debug eslint.config.ts",
    "lint-print-config": "eslint --flag unstable_ts_config --print-config eslint.config.ts",
    "lint-inspect-config": "eslint --flag unstable_ts_config --inspect-config eslint.config.ts"
},
```

Next update your README accordingly:

```md title="README.md"
`npm run lint-debug-config`: will print debugging information about what gets loaded by our ESLint config
`npm run lint-print-config`: print out a json representation of what is in our ESLint config
`npm run lint-inspect-config`: will open `http://localhost:7777/` in your browser, which is a tool to help you visualize the content of our ESLint config
```

Congratulations 🎉 you are now a master ESLint debugger (and it's a good time to commit the latest changes)

> [!MORE]  
> [ESLint "Debug Your Configuration" documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/debug)  
> [ESLint "Config Inspector" readme](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/debug)  

## Language and Linter Options (optional)

We could add global **language options** like the **ecmaVersion** or set a default **parser**, but in the upcoming chapters we will use shared configuration objects, which will set those options for us

If however you want to learn more about the options that are available, then have a look at the [ESLint "configuration objects" documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#configuration-objects)

> [!MORE]  
> [ESLint "configuration objects" documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#configuration-objects)

### Reporting unused "eslint-disable comments" (optional)

When experimenting with ESLint and trying out setups, you might at some point add disable comments, but then later you decide to completely disable the rule using the ESLint rules configuration, in which case the disable comment becomes unused

> [!WARN]  
> If you are using the ESLint recommend rules, then ESLint will already add the **reportUnusedDisableDirectives** to the configuration

The easy way to spot those unused comments is by activating the ESLint Linter option:

```ts title="eslint.config.mjs"
{
    linterOptions: {
        reportUnusedDisableDirectives: 'warn'
    }
},
```

Line X: we add a new configuration object to our flat config to enable the **reportUnusedDisableDirectives** option

## Ignore folders

In this chapter we will add an **ignores** config to exclude some folders from linting, so that we end up with a file that looks like this:

```ts title="eslint.config.ts" showLineNumbers {16-21}
import path from 'node:path'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url'
import js from '@eslint/js'
import { FlatCompat } from '@eslint/eslintrc'
import type { Linter } from 'eslint'

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename)
const compat = new FlatCompat({
    baseDirectory: __dirname,
    recommendedConfig: js.configs.recommended,
    allConfig: js.configs.all
})

const ignoresConfig = [
    {
        name: 'custom/eslint/ignores',
        // the ignores option needs to be in a separate configuration object
        // replaces the .eslintignore file
        ignores: [
            '.next/',
            '.vscode/',
            'public/',
        ]
    },
] as Linter.Config[]

export default [
    ...compat.extends('next/core-web-vitals', 'next/typescript'),
    ...ignoresConfig,
] satisfies Linter.Config[]
```

Line X: we create a new **ignoresConfig** flat config

Line X: we give our config a name (we lousily follow the [ESLint Configuration Naming Conventions](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#configuration-naming-conventions)), having a name will make it easier to find the config when using debugging tools (as we saw in the [ESLint debugging tools](#eslint-debugging-tools) chapter), feel free to for example replace "custom" in the name with the name of your project, that works well too

Lines X to Y: we use the **ignores** option to tell ESLint which folders it should exclude from linting

Line Z: we add the custom **ignoresConfig** to the default export

> [!TIP]  
> when the **ignores** option gets used in its own configuration block, then it acts as global ignores, meaning it tells ESLint to always exclude those files from linting
>  
> however if the ignores is in a configuration block with other keys, then the ignores only applies to that configuration

> [!MORE]  
> [ESLint "ignores" documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/ignore)  
> [ESLint "Report unused eslint-disable comments" documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#report-unused-eslint-disable-comments)  
> [ESLint "Configuration Naming Conventions" documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#configuration-naming-conventions)  

### Ignoring folders by using gitignore

An alternative to having an ignores list in the ESLint configuration is to use the content of the `.gitignore` file to create an ESLint ignores list

For this to work you need to install one more dependency [@eslint/compat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eslint/compat):

```shell
npm i @eslint/compat@latest --save-dev --save-exact
```

Then we change the code of our `eslint.config.ts` to this:

```ts title="eslint.config.ts" showLineNumbers
import path from 'node:path'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url'
import js from '@eslint/js'
import { FlatCompat } from '@eslint/eslintrc'
import type { Linter } from 'eslint'
import { includeIgnoreFile } from '@eslint/compat'

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename)
const compat = new FlatCompat({
    baseDirectory: __dirname,
    recommendedConfig: js.configs.recommended,
    allConfig: js.configs.all
})
const gitignorePath = path.resolve(__dirname, '.gitignore')

export default [
    ...compat.extends('next/core-web-vitals', 'next/typescript'),
    includeIgnoreFile(gitignorePath),
] satisfies Linter.Config[]
```

Line X: we import the **includeIgnoreFile** function from ESLint compat package

Line Y: we set the path to our gitignore file, which is at root of our project

Line Z: we use the **includeIgnoreFile** function, which will scan the gitignore file content and turn it into a list of files and folders ESLint will **ignore**

## ESLint recommended

The second custom config that we are going to add is an ESLint custom config, which help us get rid of some FlatCompat options:

```ts title="eslint.config.ts" showLineNumbers {16-21}
import eslintPlugin from '@eslint/js'
import { FlatCompat } from '@eslint/eslintrc'
import type { Linter } from 'eslint'

const compat = new FlatCompat()

const eslintConfig = [
    {
        name: 'custom/eslint/recommended',
        files: ['**/*.ts?(x)'],
        ...eslintPlugin.configs.recommended,
    },
]

const ignoresConfig = [
    {
        name: 'custom/eslint/ignores',
        // the ignores option needs to be in a separate configuration object
        // replaces the .eslintignore file
        ignores: [
            '.next/',
            '.vscode/',
            'public/',
        ]
    },
] as Linter.Config[]

export default [
    ...compat.extends('next/core-web-vitals', 'next/typescript'),
    ...eslintConfig,
    ...ignoresConfig,
] satisfies Linter.Config[]
```

Lines A to B: first we remove two Node.js module imports as we will NOT need them anymore

Line X: we renamed the **@eslint/js** import from **js** to **eslintPlugin** for consistency (with the next plugin imports we will add soon)

Lines C to D: we remove the **FlatCompat** options as the eslint config (that we are adding next) will take care of adding the recommended ESLint rules for Javascript (and Typescript) files

Lines X to Y: we create a custom ESLint configuration to apply a recommended set of linting rules to our Javascript (and Typescript files):

* we add a name to our config
* we set the files option to `'**/*.ts?(x)'` because now that converted the last 2 .mjs files (eslint.config.mjs and next.config.mjs) to typescript we don't need to include the .mts extension anymore (if your project still uses .mts files then change the files option to `'**/*.ts?(x)', '**/*.mjs'`), good to know (as mentioned in the comment) is that a **global** ignores needs to be in a config on it's own, a global ignores tells ESLint which files and folders should get excluded from linting 

Line Z: we add the custom **eslintConfig** to the default export

> [!NOTE]  
> the changes we did here, moved the usage of ESLint recommended from the **FlatCompat** options to a custom flat config as this is more future proof (as you will see in an upcoming chapter it is possible to get rid of the compat mode completely), but mainly because it ensures that the rules only get applied to Javascript (and Typescript) files, which matters as (in a future chapter) we will lint files (like .mdx) for which we do NOT want to apply these rules

## Typescript Linting

When [we used CNA (earlier in this tutorial)](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/project-setup-using-CNA-and-first-commit) we told it that we wanted to enable Typescript, which means our current configuration uses [next/typescript](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint#typescript), which (as the documentation explains well) adds the [recommended rules](https://typescript-eslint.io/users/configs/#recommended) from the [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin)

> [!NOTE]  
> There is one major difference between classic configs and flat config setups for **typescript-eslint**, for an ESLint v8 setup you would usually install two packages, [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin) the package to the tseslint plugin and also the [@typescript-eslint/parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/parser) parser package, but since ESLint 9 most tutorials (that I saw) had switched to using a single [typescript-eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-eslint) package that contains the plugin, the parser as well as configurations

We start by installing **typescript-eslint** package using the following command: 

```shell
npm i typescript-eslint@latest --save-dev --save-exact
```

Next we will fine tune our typescript linting by adding a **custom/typescript-eslint/recommended** config:

```ts title="eslint.config.ts" showLineNumbers {4-5}
import eslintPlugin from '@eslint/js'
import { FlatCompat } from '@eslint/eslintrc'
import tseslint, { configs as tseslintConfigs } from 'typescript-eslint'
import type { FlatConfig } from '@typescript-eslint/utils/ts-eslint'

const compat = new FlatCompat()

const eslintConfig = [
    {
        name: 'custom/eslint/recommended',
        files: ['**/*.mjs', '**/*.ts?(x)'],
        ...eslintPlugin.configs.recommended,
    },
]

const ignoresConfig = [
    {
        name: 'custom/eslint/ignores',
        // the ignores option needs to be in a separate configuration object
        // replaces the .eslintignore file
        ignores: [
            '.next/',
            '.vscode/',
            'public/',
        ]
    },
] as Linter.Config[]

const tseslintConfig = tseslint.config(
    {
        name: 'custom/typescript-eslint/recommended',
        files: ['**/*.mjs', '**/*.ts?(x)'],
        extends: [
            ...tseslintConfigs.recommended,
            // OR more type checked rules
            //...tseslintConfigs.recommendedTypeChecked,
            // OR more strict rules
            //...tseslintConfigs.strict,
            // OR more strict and type checked rules
            //...tseslintConfigs.strictTypeChecked,
            // optional stylistic rules
            ...tseslintConfigs.stylistic,
            // OR the type checked version
            //...tseslintConfigs.stylisticTypeChecked,
        ] as FlatConfig.ConfigArray,
        // only needed if you use TypeChecked rules
        languageOptions: {
            parserOptions: {
                // https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting
                projectService: true,
                tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
                // react recommended is already adding the ecmaFeatures
                /*ecmaFeatures: {
                    jsx: true,
                },*/
                // it is recommended to keep version warnings turned on
                warnOnUnsupportedTypeScriptVersion: true,
            },
        },
    },
    {
        // disable type-aware linting on JS files
        // only needed if you use TypeChecked rules
        // (and you have javascript files in your project)
        files: ['**/*.mjs'],
        ...tseslintConfigs.disableTypeChecked,
        name: 'custom/typescript-eslint/disable-type-checked',
    },
)

export default [
    ...compat.extends('next/core-web-vitals'),
    ...eslintConfig,
    ...ignoresConfig,
    ...tseslintConfig,
] satisfies FlatConfig.Config[]
```

Line X: we import typescript-eslint (which we installed in the previous step)

Line Y: we import the **Config** type from the **@typescript-eslint** utilities (which we will use to replace the [type from the ESLint package](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#typescript-configuration-files))

Line A: we use the `config()` function from the typescript-eslint package to create a typescript eslint config

Line X: first we specify that the name for custom flat config will be **tseslintConfig**

Line F: We use the `files` option to tell ESLint which files (extensions) we want to include (for this tutorial we will enable linting for [ES Module (esm)](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules) files (.mjs), for regular [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (.ts) and also for Typescript & [JSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) files (.tsx))

Lines X to X: we use the **extends** option to add full sets of rules to our setup (you can still fine tune rules from those sets using the rules config option):

For the [typescript-eslint rules](https://typescript-eslint.io/users/configs) you have different `tseslint.configs.*` you can chose from, the **recommended** is config contains a set of recommended rules (this is what Next.js uses), there is also **recommendedTypeChecked** which adds recommended rules that require type information; Next we have **strict** and **StrictTypeChecked**, which you could use instead of the recommended rules, these sets include rules are more opinionated (which is why some projects don't use them, however they can help catch bugs so I recommend giving it a try, you can still disable them later by switching back to **recommended** rules or you could disable some of the rules by setting them to off)

Then we have to chose between two more sets of rules, the **stylistic** set contains rules that do NOT impact program logic but focus on enforcing "simpler code patterns", which means they are even more , and then there is **stylisticTypeChecked** the second option (which I will use in this tutorial) which adds a few more stylistic rules that require type information

> [!TIP]  
> To better understand what is in those sets I **highly** recommend checking out the typescript-eslint [rules overview](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/) page

Lines F to G: Then we add some parser options to configure the typescript-eslint parser; the [projectService](https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/announcing-typescript-eslint-v8-beta/#project-service) got introduced in typescript-eslint v8, as they explain in their [performance documentation](https://typescript-eslint.io/troubleshooting/typed-linting/performance/#traditional-project-issues) it is recommended to use the default **projectService** when ever possible, they also point out that adding the path to your tsconfig.json manually "cause more disk IO", which would [result in a slower linting process (issue #2611)](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/2611); those options are only needed if you use typed linting, so when you use one of the **"type checked"** sets (if are NOT using any `TypeChecked` rules, then you can comment out or delete the `languageOptions` block)

> [!NOTE]  
> the **ecmaFeatures** parser option in the **languageOptions** is commented out because there are other configurations (that we will add to our setup in an upcoming chapter) that set these options for us  
>  
> I keep the comment for now as reminder, but will delete it when we add the eslint-plugin-react package, as this package will already set the option  

Line X: It is recommended to keep the typescript-eslint [warnOnUnsupportedTypeScriptVersion](https://typescript-eslint.io/packages/parser/#warnonunsupportedtypescriptversion) option enabled (which is why I explicitly added it to the config), if the Typescript version that you have installed is higher than the version typescript-eslint supports then it will show a warning message (when launching the linting process)

Lines X to X: we create yet another config to tell typescript eslint to apply the **disableTypeChecked** option when parsing [ES Module (esm)](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules) files (.mjs)

> [!NOTE]  
> For this config we add the custom/typescript-eslint/disable-type-checked **name** at the end, this is because the order matters; if we would have set the name first and then added the **disableTypeChecked** config, then our name would get replaced by the name that the config sets; but because we add our name last it will replace the name that got set by the disableTypeChecked config

Line C: we can now remove `next/typescript` from the compatibility mode (compat.extends), as it gets replaced by our custom typescript-eslint config

Line D: we set the **Config** type from the **@typescript-eslint** utilities as type for our default export (to replace the [type from the ESLint package](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#typescript-configuration-files) which is what we were using previously), the reason to switch for the **Config** type from ESLint to the one from **@typescript-eslint** utilities is because of issues related with the type of the default export, you can read more about those issues in the next chapter

> [!MORE]  
> [typescript-eslint "rules" overview](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/)  
> [typescript-eslint "type checked" documentation](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting/)  
> [typescript-eslint "performance" documentation](https://typescript-eslint.io/troubleshooting/typed-linting/performance/)  

### Why we switched from ESLint to typescript-eslint types

In the first ESLint chapters, we used the [type from the ESLint package](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#typescript-configuration-files) like this:

```ts
import type { Linter } from 'eslint'
```
(...)
```ts
] satisfies Linter.Config[]
```

However if do keep using those types and want to use typescript-eslint then you do will start to see typescript errors like this one:

> Type `(Config | FlatConfig)[]` does not satisfy the expected type `Config<RulesRecord>[]`.

There are several related tickets about this, like for example [issue #8613](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8613#issuecomment-1983584487) and [issue #9724](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/9724), the TLDR is use the types from typescript-eslint

This is why in the latest example, we switched to use the type from the typescript-eslint package instead:

```ts
import type { FlatConfig } from '@typescript-eslint/utils/ts-eslint'
```
(...)
```ts
] satisfies FlatConfig.Config[]
```

## Replacing **eslint-config-next** with a custom flat config

Before we can start adding linting for MDX files and markdown content we first need to get rid of **eslint-config-next**

> [!WARN]  
> I usually recommend to only remove component(s) or disable a feature(s) of a framework if it is really necessary, as doing so will increase your maintenance costs and your technical debt counter will go up, there are however situations where it is ok to make the transition  
>  
> In the future **eslint-config-next** will hopefully get converted to a real ESLint v9 [sharable flat config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/shareable-configs) and then this chapter will be obsolete  

As we saw in the [Why does Next.js have two packages related to ESLINT?](#why-does-nextjs-have-two-packages-related-to-eslint) **eslint-config-next** has added several plugins to your linting setup, however as we want to get rid of **eslint-config-next** we will now need to manually re-add support for those packages

> [!NOTE]  
> In this tutorial we will use the [eslint-plugin-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import) package (as does eslint-config-next), there is also [eslint-plugin-import-x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import-x), which is another popular choice you might want to try out 
>  
> We will also NOT use [@rushstack/eslint-patch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rushstack/eslint-patch) (which is now [ESLint v9 compatible](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/pull/4719)), however if you use Next.js in a big monorepo then you should probably install / configure it too  
>  
> For current situation of the eslint-plugin-react-hooks plugin is similar to the situation of the Next.js eslint plugin, the [PR (#28773)](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28773) to add "ESLint v9 support" to the react-hooks plugin got merged, however the ticket about adding [support for flat config](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/28313) is not closed (yet), there is however a [PR (#30774)](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30774) in the works

The plugins we will use are [eslint-plugin-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import) (and if you use typescript also [eslint-import-resolver-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-typescript)), [eslint-plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react), [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks), [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y), and we install them using the following command: 

```shell
npm i eslint-plugin-import@latest eslint-import-resolver-typescript@latest eslint-plugin-react@latest eslint-plugin-react-hooks@latest eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@latest --save-dev --save-exact
```

As we are attempting to reproduce what **eslint-config-next**, this means that we are installing dependencies that we already in the project, but it will make sure that we are not missing a package in our stack and it will ensure we have the latest version installed for each of them (as we added the @latest tag in the command(s))

If you are using Typescript, you will also want to install the following types:

```shell
npm i @types/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@latest --save-dev --save-exact
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Unfortunately several packages (eslint-plugin-react-hooks, eslint-plugin-import and @next/eslint-plugin-next) have no types, but I assume this will change as more users transition to .ts config files

Now that we have our packages installed we can finally start updating our eslint.config.ts again:

```ts title="eslint.config.ts" showLineNumbers {4-5}
import eslintPlugin from '@eslint/js'
import tseslint, { configs as tseslintConfigs } from 'typescript-eslint'

    },

        },
    },
    {
        // disable type-aware linting on JS files

```

Lines A to B: we import the 5 plugins

> [!NOTE]  
> If our configuration is a typescript file, then you have to use a typescript comment to inform typescript that it will not find the types for some of the packages

Line X: we create a custom config to replace configuration from eslint-config-next package

Line X: we set the name of our config to **custom/next/config**

Lines X to X: we add the 5 plugins to the config (we use an eslint disable comment for the 3 plugins that don't have types)

Lines X to X: we use rules option to add entire sets of rules to our config but then also to fine tune some of the rules (from those sets): 

* we first add the **react** (eslint plugin) **recommended** rules set
  * more details about each rules can be found in their [eslint-plugin-react readme](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react?tab=readme-ov-file#list-of-supported-rules))
* next we add the **react jsx-runtime** rules (since [React 17 the new JSX transform](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html#removing-unused-react-imports) will automatically import the necessary "jsx-runtime functions" rules (for example rules that were checking if React was in scope when using JSX are not needed anymore)
* the third set we are add are the **recommended** rules from the **react-hooks** plugin
* then we add the **@next/next** (Next.js ESLint) plugin rules, we add the recommend as well as the strict rules (which also get called "core web vitals rules" as it contains rules that will help you improve your core web vitals by using tools that are built in Next.js)
* then we add the **recommend** rules set from the **import** plugin
  * if you use typescript, then there the import plugin also has an additional set of typescript rules, which we are however **NOT** using due to a problem with some imports ([as described in the eslint-plugin-import issue #2969)](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/2969)); Instead we earlier added the [eslint-import-resolver-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-typescript) package to handle imports in typescript files properly (and later we will add some options to the **settings** to make this work)
  * more details about each rules can be found in their [eslint-plugin-import readme](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import?tab=readme-ov-file#rules)
* next we add the recommend **eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y** rules, this plugin offers two sets of [rules](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y?tab=readme-ov-file#shareable-configs) the **recommended** and the **strict**, we will use the strict version (feel free to use recommended instead if you prefer less strict rules or disable some of the more strict rules manually)

Lines X to X: next we have the use the settings option to pass some options to the plugins we are using, the first setting is for react plugin and tells the plugin to automatically detect what react version we are using (this often works well and avoids having to update a version manually), then we set the **alwaysTryTypes** setting from our import resolver to true (there are [more options](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-import-resolver-typescript/blob/master/README.md#configuration) you could set, if for example you use a monorepo), to explain what this does I will quote the explanation from their readme:

> always try to resolve types under `<root>@types` directory even it doesn't contain any source code, like `@types/unist`

Congratulations 🎉 you just added a custom next config to your linting setup, which means your `npm run lint` command will now also detect problems related to react, hooks, imports, next.js and accessibility

### Removing ESLintRC support

In the early chapter [ESLint 9 flat config for Next.js 15](#eslint-9-flat-config-for-nextjs-15) of this page we first converted our classic ESLintRC config to a flat config. After conversion we had two plugins that needed the **FlatCompat** import from **@eslint/eslintrc** package. Later in the [Typescript Linting](#typescript-linting) chapter we added our own Typescript-eslint configuration, which allowed us to remove **next/typescript** (the first of two plugins still depending on the compatibility mode). Then in the previews chapter we have added a custom **nextConfig**, which allowed us to remove **next/core-web-vitals**.

Now that we got rid of both plugins that required a compatibility mode we can finally also remove the **ESLintRC Library** package (as well as the types package if like me you use typescript) from our dependencies, using the following command:

```shell
npm remove @eslint/eslintrc @types/eslint__eslintrc
```

Congratulations 🎉 if you made it this far, we had to make a lot of changes, but you now know a lot more about how ESLint works, and we are now ready to start adding linting for MDX content in the next part of this tutorial
