# MDX plugins

You might have heard the word "MDX plugins" before, these **MDX plugins are either remark, rehype or recma plugins** and in in the next chapter we will see why there are 3 flavors of plugins

MDX plugins are a great way to add support for new features into your existing MDX setup, for example in this tutorial we will use one MDX (remark) plugin in the [Optimizing images](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/optimizing-using-next-image) chapter to turn the path of our images into imports, we will add a [Code highlighting plugin](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/code-highlighting-plugin) (with VSCode themes support), a [Table of Contents](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/table-of-contents-plugin) plugin, a [github like alerts](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/github-like-alerts-plugin) plugin and several more

In Next.js 15 and before you could NOT use plugins at all if you wanted to use Turbopack Rust bundler and / or the experimental mdxRs Rust compiler.

In Next.js 15.1 the Next.js team added a plugins loader written in Javascript, to add support for MDX plugins when using mdxRs and Turbopack. There is a catch though, for it to work the plugin options need to be serializable

## Difference between remark, rehype and recma plugins (optional)

This chapter contains mostly explanations about what remark and rehype plugins are. I won't mention [Recma plugins](https://github.com/mdx-js/recma/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins) as of today only a few exist, if someone mentions MDX plugins they probably either mean Rehype or Remark plugins and only very rarely [Recma](https://github.com/mdx-js/recma).

To answer what Remark is I will quote the (very informative) remark readme:

> Remark is a tool that transforms markdown with plugins. These plugins can inspect and change your markup

Regarding what Rehype is, here is a quote from the rehype readme:

> Rehype is a tool that transforms HTML with plugins. These plugins can inspect and change the HTML

This means that **remark** plugins do their work by processing your markdown before it gets transformed into HTML, while **rehype** plugins will process HTML and do their work. Then the HTML gets transformed into JSX, and then other JSX, like a React component you imported into your MDX page gets added. There is an online tool that let's you experiment with this workflow, it is called [MDX playground](https://mdxjs.com/playground/), you can modify the input and then use the select field to switch between different modes, to see the corresponding output on the right

You will sometimes find a plugin for **remark** and then another plugin for **rehype**, but both do the same thing, for example, a plugin that would make a table of contents by listing all headings in your content, if it is a **remark** plugin it would search for headings like `# foo{:md}`, `## bar{:md}`, `### baz{:md}` in your markdown, while a similar **rehype** plugin would look for headings `<h1>foo</h1>{:html}`, `<h2>bar</h2>{:html}`, `<h3>baz</h3>{:html}` in the HTML (after markdown got converted to HTML). In such a case it is up to you to decide which one you want to use, there is no right or wrong here, just take the one that has the features you need, the one with more detailed documentation, the most stars on GitHub or the one with the least open Issues (it is up to you to define what criteria you want to use to judge which one is better)

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are interested in learning the difference between remark and rehype, I recommend checking out my [MDX post](/web_development/posts/mdx)  

In the previous chapter we already installed a **rehype-mdx-import-media** a Rehype plugin to convert all image paths to static imports and in the following parts of the tutorial, we will install and configure several [remark plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) and [rehype plugins](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) to add some interesting features to our MDX setup

## Turbopack (optional)

**Turbopack** is a bundler, other bundlers you may know are [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/about) (the bundler from the vite team). A major difference between Webpack (which is the standard bundler in Next.js) and Turbopack (a bundler that is now the default for development but is NOT getting used in production), is that Webpack is written Javascript and Turbopack is written in Rust. The goal is to speed up the building process by using a memory safe programming language like Rust. One problem is that you can't just use your previous Webpack plugins written in Javascript and use them in Turbopack. 

The same day the Next.js team announced the release of Next.js 15 they also announced that [Turbopack is now stable **for dev**](https://nextjs.org/blog/turbopack-for-development-stable)

> [Next.js "next.config turbo option" api-reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbo)  

## SWC (optional)

**SWC** is a Javascript compiler, it is a tool similar to [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). A big difference is that Babel is written in Javascript and Babel is written in Rust. The reasons behind switching programming languages are the same as for Turbopack, using a memory safe programming language like Rust that can do the work faster than a Javascript. The disadvantages are the same, you can't just take Babel plugins written in Javascript (like for example the React compiler, which is a babel plugin won't work when using SWC)

> [Next.js "next.config turbo option" api-reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbo)  

## mdxjs-rs (optional)

**mdxjs-rs** is written in Rust (like SWC and Turbopack) and can replace [@mdx-js/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdx-js/mdx) written in Javascript (as we saw in the [Next.js 15 MDX Rust compiler](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/nextjs-mdx-setup#nextjs-15-mdx-rust-compiler) (experimental) page earlier in this tutorial)

**mdxjs-rs** compiles your MDX content (markdown with JSX, JavaScript expressions, and ESM import/exports) into JavaScript. mdxjs-rs uses [markdown-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs) to compile markdown to javascript and it uses [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) to compile the Javascript code that us in your MDX content.

## Enabling the MDX Rust compiler in Next.js 15

[Next.js v13.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-2#rust-mdx-parser) was the first version to add support for the MDX Rust compiler (mdxjs-rs) by introducing the [mdxRs (experimental) configuration option](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/mdxRs)

A basic Next.js 15 config that enables mdxRs would look like this:

```ts title="next.config.ts"
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
import createMdx from '@next/mdx'

const nextConfig = (/*phase: string*/): NextConfig => {

    const withMDX = createMdx({
        options: {
            remarkPlugins: [],
            rehypePlugins: [],
        },
    })

    const nextConfigOptions = {
        experimental: {
            mdxRs: true
        },
        pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'mdx'],
    }

    return withMDX(nextConfigOptions)


}

export default nextConfig
```

## Does mdxRs support MDX (remark / rehype) plugins?

If we now add 2 MDX (one remark and one rehype) plugins to our configuration:



As they mention in their **mdxjs-rs** [README](https://github.com/wooorm/mdxjs-rs#when-should-i-use-this):

> This project does not yet support plugins.

> [!NOTE]  
> markdown-rs has an Issue that tracks the [Enable custom plugins #32](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs/issues/32) feature, which you may want to subscribe to if you are interested in getting notifications about the progress

## 

Next we add 2 MDX (one remark and one rehype) plugins to our configuration:

```ts title="next.config.ts"
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
import createMdx from '@next/mdx'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import { rehypeGithubAlerts } from 'rehype-github-alerts'

const nextConfig = (/*phase: string*/): NextConfig => {

    const withMDX = createMdx({
        options: {
            remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
            rehypePlugins: [rehypeGithubAlerts],
        },
    })

    const nextConfigOptions = {
        experimental: {
            mdxRs: true
        },
        pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'mdx'],
    }

    return withMDX(nextConfigOptions)


}

export default nextConfig
```

In Next 15 if we enable mdxRs and add plugins using the same configuration we had in our Next.js 14 project, then we will get the following error: 

```shell
@next\mdx\mdx-rs-loader.js for match "*.mdx" does not have serializable options. Ensure that options passed are plain JavaScript objects and values.
```

To fix this we have to pass the plugins as names and the options need to be serializable:

```ts title="next.config.ts"
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
import createMdx from '@next/mdx'

const nextConfig = (/*phase: string*/): NextConfig => {

    const remarkGfmOptions = {
        singleTilde: false,
    }

    const rehypeGithubAlertsOptions = {
        supportLegacy: false,
    }

    const withMDX = createMdx({
        options: {
            remarkPlugins: [['remark-gfm', remarkGfmOptions]],
            rehypePlugins: [['rehype-github-alerts', rehypeGithubAlertsOptions]],
        },
    })

    const nextConfigOptions = {
        experimental: {
            mdxRs: true
        },
        pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'mdx'],
    }

    return withMDX(nextConfigOptions)


}

export default nextConfig
```

In Next.js 15 this was the end of the road

[MDX plugins with Turbopack](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx#using-plugins-with-turbopack) documentation















Next.js 13.2.0 to 15.0.0 (included)

We reuse our previous configuration example and add two example plugins (while keeping mdxRs enabled):

```js title="next.config.mjs"
import createMdx from '@next/mdx'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import { rehypeGithubAlerts } from 'rehype-github-alerts'

const nextConfig = (/*phase: string*/)/*: NextConfig*/ => {

    const withMDX = createMdx({
        options: {
            remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
            rehypePlugins: [rehypeGithubAlerts],
        },
    })

    const nextConfigOptions = {
        experimental: {
            mdxRs: true
        },
        pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'mdx'],
    }

    return withMDX(nextConfigOptions)


}

export default nextConfig
```







To use plugins you first need to disable the MDX Rust compiler in your configuration



















#### Which means also no Turbo (with plugins)

Turbopack depends on SWC to compile content like MDX and as we saw in the previous chapter SWC has no support for (remark and rehype) plugins yet, which means Turbo will exit with an error if you attempt to use it and have configured either remark or rehype plugins:

> Error: loader PATH_TO_PROJECT\node_modules\@mdx-js\loader\index.cjs for match "*.mdx" does not have serializable options. Ensure that options passed are plain JavaScript objects and values.

If you get an error like this it is likely that you have the following command in your package.json scripts:

```json
"dev": "next dev --turbopack",
```

I recommend you change your scripts to this:

```json
"dev": "next dev",
"dev-turbo": "next dev --turbopack",
```

Now your default run dev command will not use Turbopack anymore, but you still have a backup so that you can change again later (when Turbopack and SWC start supporting MDX plugins)
