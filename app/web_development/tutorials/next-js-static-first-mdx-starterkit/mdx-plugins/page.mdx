# MDX plugins

You might have heard the word "MDX plugins" before, these **MDX plugins are either remark, rehype or recma plugins** and in in the next chapter we will see why there are 3 flavors of plugins

MDX plugins are a great way to add support for new features into your existing MDX setup, for example in this tutorial we will use one MDX (remark) plugin in the [Optimizing images](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/optimizing-using-next-image) chapter to turn the path of our images into imports, we will add a [Code highlighting plugin](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/code-highlighting-plugin) (with VSCode themes support), a [Table of Contents](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/table-of-contents-plugin) plugin, a [github like alerts](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/github-like-alerts-plugin) plugin and several more

In Next.js 15 and before you could NOT use plugins at all if you wanted to use Turbopack Rust bundler and / or the experimental mdxRs Rust compiler.

In Next.js 15.1 the Next.js team added a plugins loader written in Javascript, to add support for MDX plugins when using mdxRs and Turbopack. There is a catch though, for it to work the plugin options need to be serializable

## Difference between remark, rehype and recma plugins (optional)

This chapter contains mostly explanations about what remark and rehype plugins are. I won't mention [Recma plugins](https://github.com/mdx-js/recma/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins) as of today only a few exist, if someone mentions MDX plugins they probably either mean Rehype or Remark plugins and only very rarely [Recma](https://github.com/mdx-js/recma).

To answer what Remark is I will quote the (very informative) remark readme:

> Remark is a tool that transforms markdown with plugins. These plugins can inspect and change your markup

Regarding what Rehype is, here is a quote from the rehype readme:

> Rehype is a tool that transforms HTML with plugins. These plugins can inspect and change the HTML

This means that **remark** plugins do their work by processing your markdown before it gets transformed into HTML, while **rehype** plugins will process HTML and do their work. Then the HTML gets transformed into JSX, and then other JSX, like a React component you imported into your MDX page gets added. There is an online tool that let's you experiment with this workflow, it is called [MDX playground](https://mdxjs.com/playground/), you can modify the input and then use the select field to switch between different modes, to see the corresponding output on the right

You will sometimes find a plugin for **remark** and then another plugin for **rehype**, but both do the same thing, for example, a plugin that would make a table of contents by listing all headings in your content, if it is a **remark** plugin it would search for headings like `# foo{:md}`, `## bar{:md}`, `### baz{:md}` in your markdown, while a similar **rehype** plugin would look for headings `<h1>foo</h1>{:html}`, `<h2>bar</h2>{:html}`, `<h3>baz</h3>{:html}` in the HTML (after markdown got converted to HTML). In such a case it is up to you to decide which one you want to use, there is no right or wrong here, just take the one that has the features you need, the one with more detailed documentation, the most stars on GitHub or the one with the least open Issues (it is up to you to define what criteria you want to use to judge which one is better)

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are interested in learning the difference between remark and rehype, I recommend checking out my [MDX post](/web_development/posts/mdx)  

In the previous chapter we already installed a **rehype-mdx-import-media** a Rehype plugin to convert all image paths to static imports and in the following parts of the tutorial, we will install and configure several [remark plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) and [rehype plugins](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) to add some interesting features to our MDX setup

> [rehype "plugins" README](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md)  

## Turbopack (optional)

[Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack/docs) is a bundler, other bundlers you may know are [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/about) (the bundler from the vite team). A major difference between Webpack (which is the standard bundler in Next.js) and **Turbopack** (which is now the default bundler in development but is NOT getting used in production), is that Webpack is written Javascript and Turbopack is written in Rust.

The goal when using Turbopack, is to speed up the building process by using a memory safe programming language like Rust. One problem is that you can't just use your previous Webpack plugins written in Javascript and use them in Turbopack. 

The same day the Next.js team announced the release of Next.js 15 they also announced that [Turbopack is now stable **for dev**](https://nextjs.org/blog/turbopack-for-development-stable)

> [Next.js "next.config turbo option" api-reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbo)  

## SWC (optional)

[SWC](https://swc.rs) is a Javascript compiler, similar to [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). A big difference is that Babel is written in Javascript and **SWC** is written in Rust. The reasons behind switching programming languages are the same as for Turbopack, using a memory safe programming language like Rust that can do the work faster than a Javascript. The disadvantages are the same, you can't just take Babel plugins written in Javascript (like for example the React compiler, which is a babel plugin won't work when using SWC)

> [Next.js "next.config turbo option" api-reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbo)  

## mdxjs-rs (optional)

[mdxjs-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/mdxjs-rs) is written in Rust (like SWC and Turbopack) and can replace [@mdx-js/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdx-js/mdx) written in Javascript (as we saw in the [Next.js 15 MDX Rust compiler](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-first-mdx-starterkit/nextjs-mdx-setup#nextjs-15-mdx-rust-compiler) (experimental) page earlier in this tutorial)

**mdxjs-rs** compiles your MDX content (markdown with JSX, JavaScript expressions, and ESM import/exports) into JavaScript. mdxjs-rs uses [markdown-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs) to compile markdown to javascript and it uses [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) to compile the Javascript code that us in your MDX content.

## TODO: ???

1) we have **both** mdxRs and Turbopack **disabled**

**mdxRs OFF** and **Turbopack OFF** and **plugins get imported** in next.config

next.js 15.0: plugins work
next.js 15.1: plugins work

Both work, you use a compile and build pipeline that is fully written in Javascript, it is NOT fast but it works

2) for some time the Next.js MDX documentation has a chapter to encourage you to try out the experimental **mdxRs** option

**mdxRs ON** and **Turbopack OFF** and **plugins get imported** in next.config

next.js 15.0: plugin(s) loading silently fails
next.js 15.1: plugin(s) loading silently fails

When you enable the [mdxRs (experimental) configuration option](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/mdxRs) you are telling **@next/mdx** to use [mdxjs-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/mdxjs-rs), @next/mdx will use its custom mdx-rs-loader loader to configure mdxjs-rs (the MDX rust compiler)

As they mention in their **mdxjs-rs** [README](https://github.com/wooorm/mdxjs-rs#when-should-i-use-this):

> This project does not yet support plugins.

This is why our plugins silently fail, the mdxjs-rs (MDX compiler written in rust) does compile our markdown using markdown-rs, but as markdown-rs has no support for plugins it just ignores them.

Even if mdxjs-rs (markdown-rs) had support for plugins, then I assume that you would have to use plugins written in Rust and not the plugins we currently use which are written in Javascript.

> [!NOTE]  
> markdown-rs has an Issue that tracks the [Enable custom plugins #32](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs/issues/32) feature, which you may want to subscribe to if you are interested in getting notifications about the progress

3) now we also enable **Turbopack**

**mdxRs ON** and **Turbopack ON** and **plugins get imported** in next.config

next.js 15.0: Error: loader @next\mdx\mdx-rs-loader.js for match "*.mdx" does not have serializable options. Ensure that options passed are plain JavaScript objects and values.
next.js 15.1: Error: loader @next\mdx\mdx-rs-loader.js for match "*.mdx" does not have serializable options. Ensure that options passed are plain JavaScript objects and values.

This time we get an Error from SWC (which has detected that we use Turbopack). It did an additional check to see if our plugin options are serializable and the **plugin name is a sting** and **NOT an import**

Everything in the plugin options needs to be serializable, as you can only pass a string to Turbopack as it is written in Rust

4) we convert the plugin import to using the plugin name (a string)

**mdxRs ON** and **Turbopack ON** and **plugin name as string** in next.config

next.js 15.0: plugin(s) loading silently fails
next.js 15.1: plugin(s) loading silently fails

What happens here is that **@next/mdx** will check if we use mdxRs and as we do **@next/mdx** will use its **mdx-rs-loader**

In the Next.js 15.1 release notes, there is the following entry:

> \[Improvement\] Support providing MDX plugins as strings for Turbopack compatibility (PR)

But wait, isn't that exactly what we just did? Yes it is... The plugins silently failing is the same result we have in the second test 2, the difference is that this time we have enabled Turbopack and are using a the plugin name instead of an import as this is a Turbopack requirement, but in the end we still use mdxRs which as we saw will silently fail as it does NOT support plugins

After digging a bit in the @next/mdx code I noticed that the **new loader they added in Next.js 15.1, only gets used when mdxRs is disabled**

5) we disable mdxRs

**mdxRs OFF** and **Turbopack ON** and **plugin name as string** in next.config

next.js 15.0: TypeError: Expected usable value, not `rehype-slug`
next.js 15.1: TypeError: Expected usable value, not `rehype-slug`

@mdx-js/loader is NOT happy with the string we passed him

TODO: I expected this error from the v15 but not the v15.1 which has the new loader, did the loader fail on my plugin ???

I digged in the code of the @next/mdx/mdx-js-loader and noticed that this new loader expect plugins to be an array (prior versions allowed us to not use an array if we did not have plugin options)

And then I bumped into something I assume is a bug on windows:

Error: Only URLs with a scheme in: file, data, and node are supported by the default ESM loader. On Windows, absolute paths must be valid file:// URLs. Received protocol 'c:'


### tldr

when you don't use Turbopack you can import MDX plugins in the next.config, unless you use a next.config.ts then you will likely not be able to import the plugin, as most MDX plugins are ESM plugins which is something next.config.ts does NOT yet support
if you use Turbopack, then make sure your MDX plugins have serializable options and make sure mdxRs is disabled








TODO: is this really a windows only bug??

When using the following config ([taken from the docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/mdx#using-plugins-with-turbopack)), where mdxRs is false:

```ts title="next.config.ts"
import createMDX from '@next/mdx'

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
    experimental: {
        mdxRs: false,
    },
}

const withMDX = createMDX({
    options: {
        remarkPlugins: [],
        rehypePlugins: [['rehype-katex', { strict: true, throwOnError: true }]],
    },
})

export default withMDX(nextConfig)
```

when enabling turbopack `next dev --turbo` I get this error:

```shell
Error: Only URLs with a scheme in: file, data, and node are supported by the default ESM loader. On Windows, absolute paths must be valid file:// URLs. Received protocol 'c:'
```

when mdxRs is false: and you use at least Next.js v15.1.0, then @next/mdx will use it's new webpack **mdx js loader** (@next/mdx/mdx-js-loader)
when mdxRs is true: @next/mdx will use it's own webpack **mdx rs loader** (@next/mdx/mdx-rs-loader) which will configure pass options to mdx-rs

previously (in Next.js 15.0.0 and before) @next/mdx would directly use @mdx-js/loader, which allowed us to import plugins in the next config and then use them in the createMDX options

in Next.js 15.1 @next/mdx got a new webpack loader which requires you to pass the plugin name to the createMDX options (instead of the imported plugin itself), the second condition is that plugin options need to be serializable
when both conditions are met, you end up with a config that now looks like this:















## Enabling the MDX Rust compiler in Next.js 15

[Next.js v13.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-2#rust-mdx-parser) was the first version to add support for the MDX Rust compiler (mdxjs-rs) by introducing the [mdxRs (experimental) configuration option](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/mdxRs)

A basic Next.js 15 config that enables mdxRs would look like this:

```ts title="next.config.ts"
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
import createMdx from '@next/mdx'

const nextConfig = (/*phase: string*/): NextConfig => {

    const withMDX = createMdx({
        options: {
            remarkPlugins: [],
            rehypePlugins: [],
        },
    })

    const nextConfigOptions = {
        experimental: {
            mdxRs: true
        },
        pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'mdx'],
    }

    return withMDX(nextConfigOptions)


}

export default nextConfig
```

## Does mdxRs support MDX (remark / rehype) plugins?

If we now add 2 MDX (one remark and one rehype) plugins to our configuration:

```ts title="next.config.ts"
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
import createMdx from '@next/mdx'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import { rehypeGithubAlerts } from 'rehype-github-alerts'

const nextConfig = (/*phase: string*/): NextConfig => {

    const withMDX = createMdx({
        options: {
            remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
            rehypePlugins: [rehypeGithubAlerts],
        },
    })

    const nextConfigOptions = {
        experimental: {
            mdxRs: true
        },
        pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'mdx'],
    }

    return withMDX(nextConfigOptions)


}

export default nextConfig
```

As they mention in their **mdxjs-rs** [README](https://github.com/wooorm/mdxjs-rs#when-should-i-use-this):

> This project does not yet support plugins.

> [!NOTE]  
> markdown-rs has an Issue that tracks the [Enable custom plugins #32](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs/issues/32) feature, which you may want to subscribe to if you are interested in getting notifications about the progress

## 

Next we add 2 MDX (one remark and one rehype) plugins to our configuration:

```ts title="next.config.ts"
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
import createMdx from '@next/mdx'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import { rehypeGithubAlerts } from 'rehype-github-alerts'

const nextConfig = (/*phase: string*/): NextConfig => {

    const withMDX = createMdx({
        options: {
            remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
            rehypePlugins: [rehypeGithubAlerts],
        },
    })

    const nextConfigOptions = {
        experimental: {
            mdxRs: true
        },
        pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'mdx'],
    }

    return withMDX(nextConfigOptions)


}

export default nextConfig
```

In Next 15 if we enable mdxRs and add plugins using the same configuration we had in our Next.js 14 project, then we will get the following error: 

```shell
@next\mdx\mdx-rs-loader.js for match "*.mdx" does not have serializable options. Ensure that options passed are plain JavaScript objects and values.
```

To fix this we have to pass the plugins as names and the options need to be serializable:

```ts title="next.config.ts"
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
import createMdx from '@next/mdx'

const nextConfig = (/*phase: string*/): NextConfig => {

    const remarkGfmOptions = {
        singleTilde: false,
    }

    const rehypeGithubAlertsOptions = {
        supportLegacy: false,
    }

    const withMDX = createMdx({
        options: {
            remarkPlugins: [['remark-gfm', remarkGfmOptions]],
            rehypePlugins: [['rehype-github-alerts', rehypeGithubAlertsOptions]],
        },
    })

    const nextConfigOptions = {
        experimental: {
            mdxRs: true
        },
        pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'mdx'],
    }

    return withMDX(nextConfigOptions)


}

export default nextConfig
```

In Next.js 15 this was the end of the road

[MDX plugins with Turbopack](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx#using-plugins-with-turbopack) documentation















Next.js 13.2.0 to 15.0.0 (included)

We reuse our previous configuration example and add two example plugins (while keeping mdxRs enabled):

```js title="next.config.mjs"
import createMdx from '@next/mdx'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import { rehypeGithubAlerts } from 'rehype-github-alerts'

const nextConfig = (/*phase: string*/)/*: NextConfig*/ => {

    const withMDX = createMdx({
        options: {
            remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
            rehypePlugins: [rehypeGithubAlerts],
        },
    })

    const nextConfigOptions = {
        experimental: {
            mdxRs: true
        },
        pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'mdx'],
    }

    return withMDX(nextConfigOptions)


}

export default nextConfig
```







To use plugins you first need to disable the MDX Rust compiler in your configuration



















#### Which means also no Turbo (with plugins)

Turbopack depends on SWC to compile content like MDX and as we saw in the previous chapter SWC has no support for (remark and rehype) plugins yet, which means Turbo will exit with an error if you attempt to use it and have configured either remark or rehype plugins:

> Error: loader PATH_TO_PROJECT\node_modules\@mdx-js\loader\index.cjs for match "*.mdx" does not have serializable options. Ensure that options passed are plain JavaScript objects and values.

If you get an error like this it is likely that you have the following command in your package.json scripts:

```json
"dev": "next dev --turbopack",
```

I recommend you change your scripts to this:

```json
"dev": "next dev",
"dev-turbo": "next dev --turbopack",
```

Now your default run dev command will not use Turbopack anymore, but you still have a backup so that you can change again later (when Turbopack and SWC start supporting MDX plugins)
