# Next.js 15 MDX support

In this part of the tutorial, we are finally going to add [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (version 3) support to our Next.js 15 project by using [@next/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx)

## Why use markdown (MDX)?

As a developer, using Markdown to format content makes sense, as most of us probably already know Markdown because we have been using it when formatting our project READMEs, or when opening Issues or participating in Discussions on GitHub, or when formatting questions and answers on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help), or even in messages on a [Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline) server

This is why I chose to use MDX (markdown + JSX) for this "static Next.js blog" project

> [Discord "markdown" formatting](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline)  

## Adding MDX support to our Next.js project

To add MDX support to the Next.js blog, I will use [@next/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx), which is an MDX package by the same team that is behind Next.js, but other alternatives work well too, I listed some of them in the [@next/mdx alternatives chapter](/web_development/posts/mdx#nextmdx-alternatives) in my **MDX post**

You can also create your own package, in which case I recommend you start by reading the **Deep Dive: How do you transform markdown into HTML?** section of the [Next.js "Markdown and MDX" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx#deep-dive-how-do-you-transform-markdown-into-html)

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to get more background information about MDX, I recommend checking out my [MDX post](/web_development/posts/mdx)

**@next/mdx** is stable, and I had no significant problems using it for this project, there are however a series of open Issues on GitHub, I recommend having a brief look at the [@next/mdx issues search on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/labels/Markdown%20%28MDX%29) to have an idea of what might not work or just have a look at the list when you have the feeling something is not working as it should

### @next/mdx installation

First, we will add the `@next/mdx` package and the MDX types to our Next.js project, the **@next/mdx** package will add support for MDX files to our Next.js project, to install the package execute the following command in your VSCode terminal:

```shell
npm i @next/mdx @types/mdx --save-exact
```

> [!MORE]  
> [Next.js "@next/mdx package" README](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx)  
> [MDX.com "@mdx-js/loader package" README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdx-js/loader)  

### MDX support setup

First, we need to create a new file called `mdx-components.tsx` in the root of our project (or the `./src` folder if you have configured your project to use the `./src` folder)

> [!WARN]  
> Adding the file is very important, I see a lot of posts of developers struggling with the first steps of getting MDX support to work in their Next.js project, and 90% of the cases are because they have not added the `mdx-components.tsx` file, without `mdx-components.tsx` in Next.js 13 you will get an error that says **Module not found: Can't resolve 'next-mdx-import-source-file'** and in Next.js you will get a bunch of **node_modules/@mdx-js/react/lib** related errors in your terminal, so it is mandatory to have that file at the root of the project, even if you don't use it (yet)

Then add the following content:

```tsx title="mdx-components.tsx" showLineNumbers
import type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'

// This file allows you to provide custom React components
// to be used in MDX files. You can import and use any
// React component you want, including components from
// other libraries.

// This file is required to use MDX in `app` directory.
export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
    return {
        // Allows customizing built-in components, e.g. to add styling.
        // h1: ({ children }) => <h1 style={{ fontSize: "100px" }}>{children}</h1>,
        ...components,
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]  
> If you chose to put all your files into an `./src` folder, then you need to put the `mdx-components.tsx` file into the `./src` folder and not the root of the project

Now we need to update the content of our `next.config.mjs` file (in the root of our project) to this:

```js title="next.config.mjs" showLineNumbers {3} {7-13} {34-35} {38}
import { withSentryConfig } from '@sentry/nextjs'
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
import { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } from 'next/constants'
import createMdx from '@next/mdx'

const nextConfig = (phase: string) => {

    const withMDX = createMdx({
        extension: /\.mdx$/,
        options: {
            // optional remark and rehype plugins
            remarkPlugins: [],
            rehypePlugins: [],
        },
    })

    if (phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER) {
        console.log('happy development session ;)')
    }

    const nextConfigOptions: NextConfig = {
        reactStrictMode: true,
        poweredByHeader: false,
        experimental: {
            // experimental typescript "statically typed links"
            // https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/typedRoutes
            typedRoutes: true,
        },
        headers: async () => {
            return [
                {
                    source: '/(.*)',
                    headers: securityHeadersConfig(phase)
                },
            ]
        },
        // configure `pageExtensions` to include MDX files
        pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'ts', 'tsx', 'mdx'],
    }

    return withMDX(nextConfigOptions)

}
```

> [!NOTE]  
> This configuration file is probably much shorter than the one you have in your project (if you followed my previous chapters)
>  
> I have omitted what we added in the CSP chapter and the Sentry setup so as not to have to display a huge file, but the structure is still the same, so you should be able only to copy the relevant parts (the ones that are highlighted using a different background color)

Line 3: we import the `@next/mdx` package (that we installed in the previous chapter)

Lines 7 to 13: we configure **@next/mdx** by passing an object to **createMdx**; via the options, we add support for **remark plugins** and **rehype plugins** (we will add a bunch of those plugins later)

Lines 34 and 35: we tell Next.js what extensions are valid page extensions, the pages we created so far had a `.tsx` extension, but the new MDX pages we will now add will have the `.mdx` extension, as you can see we add a bunch more here to cover all use cases. If for example, you are sure you won't use `.js` as an extension, then you can remove it from the list.

Line 38: we use the **withMDX** function we just created and pass our **nextConfigOptions** to it, which will return a configuration with MDX support

> [!MORE]  
> [Next.js "Markdown and MDX" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx)  

### Adding markdown support (optional)

The configuration we just did adds support for MDX in pages that have the extension `*.mdx`, if you want also to add support for markdown pages with the `*.md` extension, then add the extension in **2 places** like so:

```js title="next.config.mjs" showLineNumbers {9} {37} /?/#special /'md'/#special
import { withSentryConfig } from '@sentry/nextjs'
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
import { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } from 'next/constants'
import createMdx from '@next/mdx'

const nextConfig = (phase: string) => {

    const withMDX = createMdx({
        extension: /\.mdx?$/,
        options: {
            // optional remark and rehype plugins
            remarkPlugins: [],
            rehypePlugins: [],
        },
    })

    if (phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER) {
        console.log('happy development session ;)')
    }

    const nextConfigOptions: NextConfig = {
        reactStrictMode: true,
        poweredByHeader: false,
        experimental: {
            // experimental typescript "statically typed links"
            // https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/typedRoutes
            typedRoutes: true,
        },
        headers: async () => {
            return [
                {
                    source: '/(.*)',
                    headers: securityHeadersConfig(phase)
                },
            ]
        },
        // configure `pageExtensions` to include MDX files
        pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'ts', 'tsx', 'mdx', 'md'],
    }

    return withMDX(nextConfigOptions)

}
```

Line 8: we add the extension to the MDX configuration, the regex we use works because we added a question mark behind the **x** of **mdx** meaning the **x** is optional, so **md** and **mdx** both are valid extension

Line 35: we add `md` to the `pageExtensions` list

> [!NOTE]  
> It is important to add your new extension to both the MDX configuration and the Next.js pageExtensions
>  
> If you don't also add the extension to the **createMDX extension option**, then @next/mdx won't be able to parse the content of your file
>  
> If you don't add your markdown extension to the **pageExtensions**, then the Next.js app router will not be able to find your file, and it will show a 404

### Valid markdown extensions

You can use another extension for your markdown pages if you prefer, for example you might prefer using *.markdown, *.mdown, *.mkd, ... they are all valid

In that case, make sure you make **2 changes** in the `next.config.ts`, for example to allow **.md** and **.markdown** as **extensions** but NOT mdx anymore, you would change the extension option to this:

```js title="next.config.ts" showLineNumbers{8} /markdown/#special
extension: /\.(md|markdown)$/,
```

And then the **pageExtensions** option to this:

```js title="next.config.ts" showLineNumbers{36} /'markdown'/#special
pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'ts', 'tsx', 'md', 'markdown'],
```

## Next.js 15 Rust compiler

There is a brief chapter in the [Next.js MDX documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx#using-the-rust-based-mdx-compiler-experimental) about enabling the experimental rust compiler when using MDX pages:

> Next.js supports a new MDX compiler written in Rust. This compiler is still experimental and is not recommended for production use. To use the new compiler, you need to configure next.config.js when you pass it to withMDX

The most basic setup would look like this:

```js
experimental: {
    mdxRs: true,
},
```

It is now possible to specify which flavor of markdown is supported, it is not listed in the [Next.js configuration page about the Rust compiler for MDX](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/mdxRs) page but I did some tests and it worked well

You have to markdown flavor options as of now, you can chose between **commonmark** and **gfm**, and looks like this:

```js
experimental: {
    mdxRs: {
        mdxType: 'gfm' // or 'commonmark', to configure what kind of mdx syntax will be used to parse & transform
    },
},
```

This works well if your documents contain raw commonmark or github flavored markdown, but there is no support for plugins yet (more about that in the next chapter)

> [!MORE]  
> [commonmark.org](https://commonmark.org/)  
> [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/)  

### No support for MDX plugins (yet)

When Next.js mentions the Rust compiler then they are talking about [SWC](https://swc.rs/), mdxRs the Rust compiler for MDX is the [mdxjs-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/mdxjs-rs) package, it uses the [markdown-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs) package to parse markdown and **SWC** for everything that is javascript

It is the **mdxjs-rs** [README](https://github.com/wooorm/mdxjs-rs#when-should-i-use-this) that has the information that plugins are not supported yet, their readme states that:

> This project does not yet support plugins

There is a support ticket you may want to subscribe to if you are interested in getting notifications about the progress for plugin support in markdown-rs: [Enable custom plugins #32](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs/issues/32)

So (as of now Oct 2024), if you need plugins you will have to turn mdxRs off:

```js
experimental: {
    mdxRs: false,
},
```

#### Which means also no Turbo (with plugins)

Turbopack depends on SWC to compile content like MDX and as we saw in the previous chapter SWC has no support for (remark and rehype) plugins yet, which means Turbo will exit with an error if you attempt to use it and have configured either remark or rehype plugins:

> Error: loader PATH_TO_PROJECT\node_modules\@mdx-js\loader\index.cjs for match "*.mdx" does not have serializable options. Ensure that options passed are plain JavaScript objects and values.

If you get an error like this it is likely that you have the following command in your package.json scripts:

```json
"dev": "next dev --turbopack",
```

I recommend you change your scripts to this:

```json
"dev": "next dev",
"dev-turbo": "next dev --turbopack",
```

Now your default run dev command will not use Turbopack anymore, but you still have a backup so that you can change again later (when Turbopack and SWC start supporting MDX plugins)

## Disabling mdxRs and installing @mdx-js/loader instead

Later in this tutorial, we will add several plugins, which is why we are going to turn mdxRs off for now by setting the experimental **mdxRs** configuration option to **false**, but also add a comment as to why, so that in the future as soon as support for plugins gets shipped, we just need to turn it on:

```js title="next.config.mjs" showLineNumbers{20} /mdxRs: false/#special
experimental: {
    // experimental typescript "statically typed links"
    // https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/typedRoutes
    typedRoutes: true,
    // use experimental rust compiler for MDX
    // as of now (Oct 2024) there is no support for rehype & remark plugins
    // this is why it is currently commented out
    //mdxRs: true,
},
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Of course, if you don't plan on using any plugins like [remark-table-of-contents](https://github.com/chrisweb/remark-table-of-contents) or [rehype-github-alerts](https://github.com/chrisweb/rehype-github-alerts), then you can turn mdxRs on by setting the option to true

Now that we have disabled mdxRs, we also need to install the MDX webpack plugin manually using the following command:

```shell
npm i @mdx-js/loader --save-exact
```

This webpack plugin will handle parsing MDX and is a replacement for the MDX rust compiler we just disabled

> [!NOTE]  
> In Next.js 13, the @mdx-js/loader webpack plugin was a dependency of @next/mdx and would get installed when you install @next/mdx
>  
> However, since version 14, you need to install the plugin manually as the dependency is now marked as optional

> [!MORE]  
> [Next.js "mdxRs configuration option" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/mdxRs)  

## MDX page type (optional)

The following file is not mandatory, but it doesn't hurt to add the right type for MDX pages (I found this in the Next.js ["app-dir-mdx"](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/5e2ac0986f78c8e15756ec403666d20a99d3247e/examples/app-dir-mdx) example on GitHub), so (if it doesn't exist already) I recommend creating a `types` folder in the root of your project and adding a `mdx.d.ts` file with the following content:

```ts title="types/mdx.d.ts"
declare module '*.mdx' {
    let MDXComponent: (props) => JSX.Element
    export default MDXComponent
}
```

Because we used **create next app** in our tsconfig.json, we **already** have the following **include** in our `tsconfig.json` (if it isn't in your tsconfig.json, then you need to add it), which means that `*.d.ts` files will get included when typescript does the compilation:

```json title="tsconfig.json" showLineNumbers
"include": [
    "next-env.d.ts",
    "**/*.ts",
    "**/*.tsx",
    ".next/types/**/*.ts"
],
```

## Tips when using MDX

Now that our MDX setup is done, you might be interested in a few tips that make life easier when writing MDX / markdown in VSCode, if you do check out the ["VSCode markdown (and MDX) related tips" chapter](/web_development/posts/vscode#vscode-markdown-and-mdx-related-tips) in the VSCode post

Congratulations 🎉 you now have MDX support added to your project using next/mdx, in other parts of this tutorial, we will further extend that setup by adding several valuable plugins and learning how to use custom react components to fully benefit from what MDX has to offer
