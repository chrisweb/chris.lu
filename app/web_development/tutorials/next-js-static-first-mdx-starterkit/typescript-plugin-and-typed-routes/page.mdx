# Typescript plugin and typed routes

The next step is to ensure **Typescript** is correctly set up, and we will also enable an interesting feature called **statically typed routes**

## Next.js typescript plugin

Since [Next.js 13.1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-1), the Next.js team added a new Typescript plugin:

> We've built a new TypeScript plugin that provides suggestions for page and layout configuration options and provides helpful usage hints around Server and Client Components

[Delba de Oliveira](https://github.com/delbaoliveira), which is part of the Next.js developer experience team, posted a [short "Next.js Typescript plugin" introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqMqn9fKEf8) on Youtube that you may want to watch

### Enabling the Next.js Typescript plugin

To make the Next.js typescript plugin work, you need to make sure that the Typescript version that VSCode is using is the **workspace version** (the version that Next.js create app just installed) because, by default, VSCode will use a built-in Typescript version.

If you don't know yet how to change the typescript version to **workspace version** (in VSCode), check out the [VSCode typescript version](/web_development/posts/vscode#vscode-typescript-version) chapter in the VSCode post

As soon as you switch to the **workspace version**, VSCode will create a new `.vscode/settings.json` file (or if you already have a VSCode settings.json, it will extend it):

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
    "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules\\typescript\\lib"
}
```

There is nothing wrong in sharing the `.vscode/settings.json` file as it will ensure that everyone that works on your project (or if you use multiple devices yourself) will use the same workspace settings, like the typescript workspace version but also other settings, for example in one of the following chapters we will add helpful VSCode extension and VSCode will be listing in settings file, so that if someone works on your project but does not have the extension installed VSCode will show a modal that suggests installing it.

> [!TIP]  
> The Next.js typescript plugin comes with some useful features. It will for example, warn you if something is wrong in how you use the **use client** directive in your components and some more. I recommend keeping an eye on the [Next.js "typescript" documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript) as the Next.js team adds more features over time

Finally, I recommend you commit/sync the new `.vscode/settings.json`.

## Statically Typed Links (Routes)

To ensure we benefit from **statically typed links** we need to enable the feature in our Next.js configuration file

> [!NOTE]  
> I noticed a major change in Next.js 15, which is that the **next.config** file now has a **.ts** extension (when creating a project using CNA and using the `--typescript` as we did in the previous [Project setup and first commit](/web_development/tutorials/next-js-static-mdx-blog/project-setup-and-first-commit) tutorial page), in Next.js 14 the **next.config** file was still a Javascript file with an **.mjs** extension

Open the `next.config.ts` and then add the **experimental** typedRoutes to your Next.js configuration file like so:

```ts title="next.config.ts" showLineNumbers {4-8}
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
    experimental: {
        // experimental typescript "statically typed links"
        // https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/typedRoutes
        typedRoutes: true,
    }
};

export default nextConfig
```

Line 1: we import the NextConfig type, which means that when you start typing inside of the nextConfig object you will benefit from code autocompletion for the Next.js configuration options

Lines 4-8: we use the typedRoutes (experimental) option and enabled it, which means that when using `npm run dev` or `npm run build` when building for production, Next.js will generate a `.next/types/link.d.ts` file that contains information about all existing routes in our application, the advantage of this is that if we now use [next/link](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#link-component) but set the href to a route that doesn't exist we will see an error in VSCode getting displayed and builds will fail until we fix the typo in our URL

Then save your `next.config.ts` and commit/sync your latest changes.

Congratulations 🎉 you just made sure your typescript support is done correctly, which is a significant milestone before starting to code, and you now also have typed routes that will further improve your DX, adding more pages to your project
