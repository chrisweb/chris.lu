# Games

I guess I have always been more of a PC Games fan than console games, I played my first games on an [Amstrad CPC 6128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad) when I was 8 or 9 years old, the Amstrad had a CTM 644 color monitor, a disk drive, it also came with a Joystick and even a TV tuner below the screen which allowed me to also watch TV ðŸ¤¯.

The games I remember playing on my Amstrad were:
