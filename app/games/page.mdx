## Amstrad CPC 6128

I played my first games on an [Amstrad CPC 6128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad) when I was around 9 years old , the Amstrad had a CTM 644 color monitor, a disk drive, it also came with a Joystick but no mouse, everything including playing games was done solely using the keyboard and eventually the Joystick. The Amstrad CPC 6128 even came with a TV tuner that you could place below the screen and which allowed me to also watch TV ðŸ¤¯.

Some of the games I remember playing on my Amstrad were:

        [Barbarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian:_The_Ultimate_Warrior) was actually a quite brutal game, as the goal was to chop off the head of the enemy and after you did a green goblin came into the screen, kicked the head out of the screen and then dragged the body out of the screen too ðŸ˜²

## Super Nintendo (SNES)

Then a few years later I got my first console the [The Super Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System#:~:text=The%20Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System,and%201993%20in%20South%20America.) (SNES), I was fortunate to have siblings, which meant that I most of the time there was someone around to play games like Mario Kart with me, here are a few games I can remember playing on my SNES:

        ![banner image display a game screen from the SNES Super Mario World game](../../public/assets/images/app/games/snes_super_mario_world.png)
        [Super Mario World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World) was my first SNES game

    <div>
        ![banner image display a game screen from the SNES Super Mario Kart game](../../public/assets/images/app/games/snes_super_mario_kart.png)
        [Super Mario Kart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Kart) was probably the game I played the most on my SNES due to it's split screen mode(s), one mode was obviously racing but there was also a second mode called "Battle Mode" which took places in arenas and in which you had to pop the 3 balloons on the other players karts before they could pop yours, this was so much fun

## My first PC (486)

My first PC ever had a [Intel 486DX2-66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I486) processor and this was the golden age of [DOS games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS), it was also great period for adventure games, I probably played every 80s and early 90s adventure game LucasArts and Sierra would produce



## Nintendo 64

After the SNES the next console I got was the [Nintendo 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64), what suprised me most when I played the first N64 games like Mario Kart 64 in comparison with the SNES version from 5 years before

## Dreamcast (SEGA)

Another few years later I bought the [SEGA Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn), I had spent some time in amusement arcades and played games like SEGA Rally and Daytona a lot but putting coins into the machine to be able to play seemed to get very costly over time, so when SEGA released a console where I could play those games at home it was a dream come true for me, I didn't have a lot of SEGA Saturn games but here are the ones I remember most vividly:

        ![banner image display a game screen from the SEGA Saturn Sega Rally Championship game](../../public/assets/images/app/games/sega_saturn_sega_rally_championship.png)

        ![banner image display a game screen from the SEGA Saturn Virtua Cop game](../../public/assets/images/app/games/sega_saturn_virtua_cop_and_gun.png)
        [Virtua Cop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtua_Cop) the game came with a light gun called the [SEGA Virtua Gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_gun), it was like playing an arcade game at home
