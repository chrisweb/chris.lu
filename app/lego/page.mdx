# Lego

There's not much here yet, but my goal is to document my AFOL (adult fan of Lego). I have never documented my MOCs or my collection, but I plan to do so in the future.

I like to build MOCs (My Own Creation) in the evenings. It is a hobby I really like as it helps me relax after a busy day. Like every AFOL, I liked to play with Lego toys when I was young and then had my "dark ages" period before finally coming back to building Lego as an adult.

I have amassed quite a collection of bricks and Minifigures over the years, and now I often wonder if I already own a certain piece or Minifigure when I spend time on [Bricklink](https://www.bricklink.com) doing my next order. This is why I plan on working on a tool someday to help me inventory all the pieces and minifigure parts I own. I have not started yet, and it might take quite some time to get it done, but it is always nice to have some plans, isn't it? ðŸ˜‰

I have a Google document in which I add Lego MOC ideas from time to time. I plan on building a big city like the famous Lego Youtubers I like to watch when working on my own MOCs. I'm not sure I have to do so because I like being in an apartment and don't really have a big open space to do it, so this is yet another future I look forward to. ðŸ˜‰

I mostly build with real bricks but sometimes enjoy creating digital builds using the [STUDIO](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page) software. 

Here are a few pictures of a pirate ship I called "The Black Queen" that I did some time ago. I have learned new building techniques and found new interesting pieces lately, so I want to revisit my build someday and improve it. Then, hopefully, I can do a Bricklink order to get all the pieces so that I can finally build it for real.

## Lego related Youtube channels I like to watch
