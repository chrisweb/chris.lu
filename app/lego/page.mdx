Not much here yet, but my goal is document my AFOL (adult fan of Lego). I have never really documentated my MOCs or my collection yet, but I will plan to do so in the future.

I like to build MOCs (My Own Creation) in the evenings, it is a hobby I really like as it helps relax after a busy day. Like every AFOL it seems that I'm the kind of person that liked to play with Lego toys when I was young and then had my "dark ages" period to finally come back to building Lego as an adult.

I have amassed quite a collection of bricks and minfigures over the years and now I often wonder if I already own a certain piece or minifigure when I spend time on [Bricklink](https://www.bricklink.com) doing my next order. This is why I plan on working on a tool someday to help me create an inventory of all the pieces and minifigure parts I own. I have not started yet and it might take quite some time to get it done but it is always nice to have some future plans isn't it? ðŸ˜‰

I have a google document in which I add Lego Moc ideas every now and then, I plan on building a big city like the famous Lego Youtubers I like to watch when working on my own MOCs, I'm not sure I have to do so, because I like in an appartment and don't really have a big open space to do it, so this is yet another future I look forward to. ðŸ˜‰

I mostly build with real bricks but I sometimes also enjoy creating digital builds using the [STUDIO](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page) software, here are a few pictures of a pirate ship I called "The Black Queen" that I did some time ago, I have learned new building techniques and found new interesting pieces lately so I wanted to revisit my build some day and improve it and then hopefully do a Bricklink order to get all the pieces so that I can finally build it for real.
