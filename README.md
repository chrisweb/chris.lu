Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ 

This repository contains the source code for my blog ([chris.lu](https://chris.lu))

On [chris.lu](https://chris.lu), you will find my tutorials and can learn more about me

## Technologies used

During the development of the blog, I wrote a ["Next.js static MDX blog" tutorial](https://chris.lu/web-development/tutorials/next-js-static-mdx-blog) that showcases most of the technologies that I used

The framework I used is [Next.js 14](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) with [React 18](https://github.com/facebook/react) (I plan on upgrading to Next.js 15 and React 19 as soon as the first stable versions get released and will update my tutorial accordingly)

I added [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) support to be able to create content using next/mdx. I then also used several remark and rehype plugins and even built two myself, [rehype-github-alerts
](https://github.com/chrisweb/rehype-github-alerts) and [remark-table-of-contents
](https://github.com/chrisweb/remark-table-of-contents)

I had a lot of fun doing my [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) header animation using [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) (a React renderer for [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js))

I also added a jukebox on top using my [web-audio-api-player](https://github.com/chrisweb/web-audio-api-player) and added a dynamic waveform using my [waveform-visualizer](https://github.com/chrisweb/waveform-visualizer) and [waveform-data-generator](https://github.com/chrisweb/waveform-data-generator) packages
