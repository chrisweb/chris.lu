this series of articles will showcase how to build a blog using next.js 13 and focus on using features like "React Server Components", "React Streaming Components", "React Suspense"


## history

### react history

the react team released the [RFC: React Server Components](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html) as well as an experimental demo of React Server Components (RSC) in december 2020

the next announcement regarding server components came as part of a blog post announcing the release of [React v18.0](https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html), the react team mentions that the feature is considered experimental but also that they plan to release the server components in one of the next minor versions of react 18

### next.js history

in may 2022 the next.js team released the [Layouts RFC](https://nextjs.org/blog/layouts-rfc) and sketched out their ideas for server components, but also improved data fetching and things like nested layouts, alongside the RFC posted on their blog they opened a [github discussion regarding the layouts RFC](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/37136)

Question(s): regarding the new layouts system, the RFC mentioned it would be nice to have a feature that allows to "preserve the state on navigation", did they include this? if so how does it work

* URL Segment: Part of the URL path delimited by slashes

Note: this series of articles will focues on the new `app` directory and server components, I will not go into much into detail describing how to use the "classic" next.js `pages` directory and the "classic" data fetching methods like `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps` or even the legacy `getInitialProps`, but I might mention them and compare them to the "new way of doing things" to give you an idea of how we did things until today and how we will now do things starting tomorrow ;) like this little recap that follows

recap of the 1st and 2nd generation of data fetching in next.js:

* first there was `getInitialProps`, with getInitialProps the first page would render on the server and so getInitialProps would be called on the server, then if visiting another page using next/link or next/router that page would get build in the client, so any code in getInitialProps would get executed on the client side, this meant that you had to be aware if you were currently on the server and could use server side code to make a direct data fetch call to the database or if you were in the client and hence fetch the data via an ajax call to an API endpoint you would also need to code, besides that it was also important to be careful about how and what packages you were importing as you might use a package when getInitialProps is executed on the server but then that code would also be bundled into the client to be imported too when getInitialProps runs in the client, to avoid that you would need to exclude packages from the client by either using dynamic imports encapsulated into conditions that check if the code is being executed on the server or client or by using plugins that exclude those "server only" packages at build time. read more: [next.js getInitialProps documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-initial-props)
* the newer `getServerSideProps` (which first appeared in march 2020 with [Next.js 9.3](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3)) and is an async function that fetches the data and populates the props object of your page function and works differently then getInitialProps, same as with getInitialProps for the first page the code gets executed on the server and the data is being returned directly to the code of the page, but if you visit a second page getInitialProps will again get executed on the server and the data it returns will get sent as JSON to the client where again it gets used by the page code, this means using getServerSideProps instead of getInitialProps eliminated two pain points, first you did not have to care about your imports anymore as next.js would exclude those packages for you from client code automatically and the second one being that you did not have to create an API for client side data fetching anymore as next.js would go and call getServerSideProps on the server and then fetch the data as JSON for you. read more: [next.js getServerSideProps documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)
* `getStaticProps` appeared alongside getServerSideProps, the difference between the two is that getServerSideProps disables ["Automatic Static Optimization"](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization) but getStaticProps does not, getStaticProps it is a method that you would use to fetch data not at "runtime" but at "build time", so when a user visits a page no data call is being made, all data got already fetched at build time (and the page props have been put in a static json file), which means for any request being made by a user your data won't change, this can be very interesting to build pages that load super fast as they use data that does not change between two builds, however getStaticProps has a feature so that you can "revalidate" data in the background, this is what gets used by "[Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration)" and allows you to update the static data you got at build time. read more: [next.js getStaticProps documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props)

in october 2022 the next.js team released [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13) which included the first version of the new `app` folder and two months later in december [Next.js 13.1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-1)

## react server components

files inside app will be rendered on the server as "React Server Components"

Inside the app/ directory, there is a powerful new way to fetch data with Reactâ€™s use() hook and the extended Web fetch() API. This allows you to colocate data fetching directly inside components for the most flexibility, including inside layouts

Question(s): what about react Streaming, react Suspense, and react Transitions?
